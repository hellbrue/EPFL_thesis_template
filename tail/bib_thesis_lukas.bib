	abstract = {Vacuum-ultraviolet ({VUV}) light is critical for the study of molecules and materials, but the generation of femtosecond pulses in the {VUV} region at high repetition rates has proven difficult. Here we demonstrate the efficient generation of {VUV} light at megahertz repetition rates using highly cascaded four-wave mixing processes in a negative-curvature hollow-core fiber. Both even- and odd-order harmonics are generated up to the 15th harmonic (69 nm, 18.0 {eV}), with high energy resolution of ‚àº40meV. In contrast to direct high harmonic generation, this highly cascaded harmonic generation process requires lower peak intensity and therefore can operate at higher repetition rates, driven by a robust ‚àº10W fiber-laser system in a compact setup. Additionally, we present numerical simulations that explore the fundamental capabilities and spatiotemporal dynamics of highly cascaded harmonic generation. This {VUV} source can enhance the capabilities of spectroscopies of molecular and quantum materials, such as photoionization mass spectrometry and time-, angle-, and spin-resolved photoemission.},

	abstract = {The formations of charge and lattice orders are generally coupled in charge density wave ({CDW}) materials and share identical order wave vectors. Although this situation is usually satisfied in a large class of two-dimensional materials, it falls short in describing the so-called {CDW}-like phase transition in layered tantalum ditelluride ({TaTe}2), accompanied by anomalous low temperature transport properties and a periodic lattice distortion ({PLD}). Here we combine angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and low energy electron diffraction to directly access the charge and lattice structures in 1‚Å¢ùëá-polytypic {TaTe}2 and study the anomalous phase transition. Our data reveal the presence of a surprising quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surface with nesting ({FSN}) condition, despite its van der Waals layered structure. We find that the wave vectors of the {FSN} and {PLD} are different, suggesting the decoupled formation between charge and lattice orders. These conditions are accompanied by rich footprints in band structure, including Fermi surface suppression, minigaps, and satellite bands. Our results suggest that {TaTe}2 manifests intrinsic mixed dimensionality between its electronic and lattice structure and that the {CDW}-like phase transition is likely governed by multiple mechanisms. Our work provides routes for forging unconventional {CDW} phases and charge-lattice entanglement that would otherwise not be available in materials with fixed dimensionality.},

	abstract = {Ultrafast optical switching of materials properties is of great relevance both for future technological applications as well as gaining fundamental physical insights to microscopic couplings and nonequilibrium phenomena. Transition-metal dichalcogenides ({TMDCs}) combine photo-sensitivity with strong correlations, furthering rich phase diagrams and enhanced tunability. Owing to its chemical composition, \$1{\textbackslash}textit\{T'\}-{\textbackslash}text\{{TaTe}\}\_2\$ exhibits an electronically and structurally unique set of charge-density waves ({CDWs}), featuring increased conductivity and a reduced prominence of amplitude modes. Compared to other charge-ordered {TMDCs}, only very few studies addressed the ultrafast response of this material to optical excitation. In particular, the question whether such unconventional properties translate to unusual quench dynamics remains largely unresolved. Here, we investigate the structural dynamics in \$1{\textbackslash}textit\{T'\}-{\textbackslash}text\{{TaTe}\}\_2\$ by means of ultrafast nanobeam electron diffraction. The experiments are carried out with a tailored sample design that allows for excitation at 2\${\textbackslash},\${MHz} repetition rate, higher than any structural phase transformation probed thus far. Harnessing the enhanced resolution and sensitivity of this approach, we reveal a strongly directional cooperative atomic motion during the one-dimensional quench of the low-temperature trimer lattice. These dynamics are completed within less than 500\${\textbackslash},\$fs, substantially faster than reported previously. In striking contrast, the periodic lattice distortion of the room-temperature phase is unusually robust against high-density electronic excitation. In conjunction with the known sensitivity of \$1{\textbackslash}textit\{T'\}-{\textbackslash}text\{{TaTe}\}\_2\$ to chemical doping, we thus expect the material to serve as a versatile platform for tunable structural control by optical stimuli.},

While multiple mechanisms including Fermi surface nesting and chemical bonding instabilities have been intensively discussed, the origin of this transition remains elusive. Here we investigate the electronic structure of single-crystalline {TaTe}2 with a particular focus on its modifications through the phase transition, by employing core-level and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with first-principles calculations. Temperature-dependent core-level spectroscopy demonstrates a splitting of the Ta 4‚Å¢ùëì core-level spectra through the phase transition indicative of the Ta-dominated electronic state reconstruction. Low-energy electronic state measurements further reveal an unusual kink-like band reconstruction occurring at the Brillouin zone boundary, which cannot be explained by Fermi surface nesting or band-folding effects. On the basis of the orbital-projected band calculations, this band reconstruction is mainly attributed to the modifications of specific Ta 5‚Å¢ùëë states, namely, the ùëëùëã‚Å¢ùëå orbitals (the ones elongating along the ribbon chains) at the center Ta sites of the ribbon chains.

Time resolution is accomplished by using pump‚Äêand‚Äêprobe technique and the photoemitted electrons are energy analyzed in a time‚Äêof‚Äêflight detector. In order to perform photoemission, the near‚Äêinfrared light from the titanium:sapphire laser is frequency up‚Äêconverted to the vacuum ultraviolet range. This is accomplished by using the high peak power pulses from the laser system to produce short‚Äêwavelength radiation by means of harmonic generation. The system described uses cascaded frequency doubling and tripling, reaching a photon energy close to 10 {eV}.},

Using a picosecond pulsed laser, photons of energy 10.5 {eV} are generated through higher harmonic generation in xenon. The high repetition rate of the light source, variable between 0.2 and 8 {MHz}, enables high photoelectron count rates and short acquisition times. By using a time-of-flight analyzer with angle-resolving capabilities, electrons emitted from the sample within a circular cone of up to ¬±15¬∞ can be collected. Hence, simultaneous acquisition of photoemission data for a complete area of the Brillouin zone is possible. The current photon energy enables bulk sensitive measurements, high angular resolution, and the resulting covered momentum space is large enough to enclose the entire Brillouin zone in cuprate high-Tc superconductors. Fermi edge measurements on polycrystalline Au shows an energy resolution better than 5 {meV}. Data from a test measurement of the Au(111) surface state are presented along with measurements of the Fermi surface of the high-Tc superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 + Œ¥ (Bi2212).},

	abstract = {Non-equilibrium topological phenomena can be induced in quantum many-body systems using time-periodic fields (for example, by laser or microwave illumination). This Review begins with the key principles underlying Floquet band engineering, wherein such fields are used to change the topological properties of a system‚Äôs single-particle spectrum. In contrast to equilibrium systems, non-trivial band structure topology in a driven many-body system does not guarantee that robust topological behaviour will be observed. In particular, periodically driven many-body systems tend to absorb energy from their driving fields and thereby tend to heat up. We survey various strategies for overcoming this challenge of heating and for obtaining new topological phenomena in this non-equilibrium setting. We describe how drive-induced topological edge states can be probed in the regime of mesoscopic transport, and three routes for observing topological phenomena beyond the mesoscopic regime: long-lived transient dynamics and prethermalization, disorder-induced many-body localization, and engineered couplings to external baths. We discuss the types of phenomena that can be explored in each of the regimes covered, and their experimental realizations in solid-state, cold atomic, and photonic systems.},

Historically, ultrafast extreme ultraviolet sources employing high-order harmonic generation ({HHG}) have required compromises that make it challenging to achieve a high energy resolution‚Äîwhich is highly desirable for many {TR}-{ARPES} studies‚Äîwhile producing high photon energies and a high photon flux. We address this challenge by performing {HHG} inside a femtosecond enhancement cavity, realizing a practical source for {TR}-{ARPES} that achieves a flux of over 1011 photons/s delivered to the sample, operates over a range of 8‚Äì40 {eV} with a repetition rate of 60 {MHz}.

Using high photon energies, they are able to study ultrafast dynamics at high momenta, at which some of the most interesting fundamental phenomena occur. Applying the technique to the charge density wave material 1T-{TiSe}2, they obtain stroboscopic images of the electronic band structure at high momentum and show that atomic-scale periodic long-scale order collapses on a surprisingly short timescale of 20 femtoseconds.

	abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on {HgTe}‚àï{CdTe} quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on Bi1‚àí{xSbx}, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are then discussed that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

	abstract = {Ultrafast light sources have become an indispensable tool to access and understand transient phenomenon in material science. However, a simple and easy-to-implement method for harmonic selection, with high transmission efficiency and pulse duration conservation, is still a challenge. Here we showcase and compare two approaches for selecting the desired harmonic from a high harmonic generation source while achieving the above goals. The first approach is the combination of extreme ultraviolet spherical mirrors with transmission filters and the second approach uses a normal-incidence spherical grating. Both solutions target time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with photon energies in the 10-20 {eV} range but are relevant for other experimental techniques as well. The two approaches for harmonic selection are characterized in terms of focusing quality, photon flux, and temporal broadening. It is demonstrated that a focusing grating is able to provide much higher transmission as compared to the mirror+filter approach (3.3 times higher for 10.8 {eV} and 12.9 times higher for 18.1 {eV}), with only a slight temporal broadening (6.8\&\#x0025; increase) and a somewhat larger spot size (\&\#x223C;30\&\#x0025; increase). Overall, our study establishes an experimental perspective on the trade-off between a single grating normal incidence monochromator design and the use of filters. As such, it provides a basis for selecting the most appropriate approach in various fields where an easy-to-implement harmonic selection from high harmonic generation is needed.},

Recent advances in electron microscopy enable the imaging of random photogenerated individual skyrmions. However, their deterministic and dynamical manipulation is hampered by the chaotic nature of such fluctuations and the intrinsically irreversible switching between different minima in the magnetic energy landscape. Here, we demonstrate a method to coherently control the rotation of a skyrmion crystal by discrete amounts at speeds which are much faster than previously observed. By employing circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulses with an energy below the band gap of the Mott insulator Cu2OSeO3, we excite a collective magnon mode via the inverse Faraday effect. This triggers coherent magnetic oscillations that directly control the rotation of a skyrmion crystal imaged by cryo-Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. The manipulation of topological order via ultrafast laser pulses shown here can be used to engineer fast spin-based logical devices.},

Here, we show that optical excitation of lattice vibrations can induce polar order. This metastable polar phase, observed up to temperatures exceeding 290 kelvin, persists for hours after the optical pump is interrupted.

	abstract = {With its tunable band-gap and its unique optical and electronic properties black phosphorus ({BP}) opens exciting opportunities for optoelectronic nanotechnology. The band-gap extends from the visible to the mid-infrared spectral range, as a function of sample thickness and external parameters such as electric field and pressure. This, combined with the saturable absorption and in-plane anisotropic optical properties, makes {BP} a versatile platform for realizing polarization-sensitive photodetectors and absorbers. Although its near-equilibrium properties have been intensively studied, the development of efficient ultrafast optical devices requires detailed knowledge of the temporal dynamics of the photoexcited hot-carriers. Here we address the electronic response of {BP} to an ultrafast laser excitation, by means of time-and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Following the optical excitation, we directly observe a shift of the valence band ({VB}) position, indicative of band-gap renormalization ({BGR}). Our data also show that the hole population in the {VB} relaxes with a characteristic time œÑ{VB} = 10.2 ¬± 1.0 ps, while the lifetime of the electrons accumulated at the minimum of the conduction band is œÑ{CB} = 1.9 ¬± 0.2 ps. The experimental results are well reproduced by ab initio calculations of the out-of-equilibrium electronic properties. Our study sets the reference for the ultrafast carrier dynamics in {BP} and demonstrates the material‚Äôs ultrafast {BGR}, which is promising for optoelectronic switches.},

In this layered van der Waals crystal, the ferromagnetic layers couple antiparallel to each other; atomically thin {MnBi}2Te4, however, becomes ferromagnetic when the sample has an odd number of septuple layers.

The robust axion insulator state occurs in zero magnetic field, over a wide magnetic-field range and at relatively high temperatures. Moreover, a moderate magnetic field drives a quantum phase transition from the axion insulator phase to a Chern insulator phase with zero longitudinal resistance and quantized Hall resistance h/e2, where h is Planck‚Äôs constant and e is electron charge.

Here, we report on the selective area growth of (Bi,Sb)2Te3 {TI} thin films and stencil lithography of superconductive Nb for a full in situ fabrication of S‚Äì{TI} hybrid devices via molecular-beam epitaxy. A dielectric capping layer was deposited as a final step to protect the delicate surfaces of the S‚Äì{TI} hybrids at ambient conditions. Transport experiments in as-prepared Josephson junctions show highly transparent S‚Äì{TI} interfaces and a missing first Shapiro step, which indicates the presence of Majorana bound states. To move from single junctions towards complex circuitry for future topological quantum computation architectures, we monolithically integrated two aligned hardmasks to the substrate prior to growth.

A strong infrared pulse was then used to probe the ultrafast electronic and nuclear dynamics as the molecule exploded. We found that substantial fragmentation occurs through an electron-shakeup process, in which a second electron is simultaneously excited during the soft x-ray photoionization process. During fragmentation, the molecular potential seen by the electron changes rapidly from nearly spherically symmetric to a two-center molecular potential. Our approach can capture in real time and with angstrom resolution the influence of ionizing radiation on a range of molecular systems, probing dynamics that are inaccessible with the use of other techniques.},

            In recent years, the notion of ‚ÄòQuantum Materials‚Äô has emerged as a powerful unifying concept across diverse fields of science and engineering, from condensed-matter and coldatom physics to materials science and quantum computing. Beyond traditional quantum materials such as unconventional superconductors, heavy fermions, and multiferroics, the field has significantly expanded to encompass topological quantum matter, two-dimensional materials and their van der Waals heterostructures, Moir√© materials, Floquet time crystals, as well as materials and devices for quantum computation with Majorana fermions. In this Roadmap collection we aim to capture a snapshot of the most recent developments in the field, and to identify outstanding challenges and emerging opportunities. The format of the Roadmap, whereby experts in each discipline share their viewpoint and articulate their vision for quantum materials, reflects the dynamic and multifaceted nature of this research area, and is meant to encourage exchanges and discussions across traditional disciplinary boundaries. It is our hope that this collective vision will contribute to sparking new fascinating questions and activities at the intersection of materials science, condensed matter physics, device engineering, and quantum information, and to shaping a clearer landscape of quantum materials science as a new frontier of interdisciplinary scientific inquiry. We stress that this article is not meant to be a fully comprehensive review but rather an up-to-date snapshot of different areas of research on quantum materials with a minimal number of references focusing on the latest developments.},

However, the fundamental nature of p* remains unclear, in particular regarding whether it marks a true quantum phase transition. Here we measure the specific heat C of the cuprates Eu-{LSCO} and Nd-{LSCO} at low temperature in magnetic fields large enough to suppress superconductivity, over a wide doping range2 that includes p*. As a function of doping, we find that Cel/T is strongly peaked at p*¬†(where Cel is the electronic contribution to C) and exhibits a log(1/T) dependence as temperature T tends to zero. These are the classic thermodynamic signatures of a quantum critical point3‚Äì5, as observed in heavy-fermion6 and iron-based7 superconductors at the point where their antiferromagnetic phase comes to an end. We conclude that the pseudogap phase of cuprates ends at a quantum critical point, the associated fluctuations of which are probably involved in d-wave pairing and the anomalous scattering of charge carriers.},

However, the full potential of this approach has not yet been achieved because, to date, high harmonics generated by 800nm wavelength Ti:Sapphire lasers required a trade-off between photon flux, energy and time resolution. Photoemission spectroscopy requires a quasi-monochromatic output, but dispersive optical elements that select a single harmonic can significantly reduce the photon flux and time resolution. Here we show that 400nm driven high harmonic extreme-ultraviolet {trARPES} is superior to using 800nm laser drivers since it eliminates the need for any spectral selection, thereby increasing photon flux and energy resolution to {\textless}150meV while preserving excellent time resolution of about 30fs.},

	abstract = {Time-resolved photoemission with ultrafast pump and probe pulses is an emerging technique with wide application potential. Real-time recording of nonequilibrium electronic processes, transient states in chemical reactions, or the interplay of electronic and structural dynamics offers fascinating opportunities for future research. Combining valence-band and core-level spectroscopy with photoelectron diffraction for electronic, chemical, and structural analyses requires few 10 fs soft X-ray pulses with some 10 {meV} spectral resolution, which are currently available at high repetition rate free-electron lasers. We have constructed and optimized a versatile setup commissioned at {FLASH}/{PG}2 that combines free-electron laser capabilities together with a multidimensional recording scheme for photoemission studies. We use a full-field imaging momentum microscope with time-of-flight energy recording as the detector for mapping of 3D band structures in (kx, ky, E) parameter space with unprecedented efficiency. Our instrument can image full surface Brillouin zones with up to 7 √Ö‚àí1 diameter in a binding-energy range of several {eV}, resolving about 2.5 √ó 105 data voxels simultaneously. Using the ultrafast excited state dynamics in the van der Waals semiconductor {WSe}2 measured at photon energies of 36.5 {eV} and 109.5 {eV}, we demonstrate an experimental energy resolution of 130 {meV}, a momentum resolution of 0.06 √Ö‚àí1, and a system response function of 150 fs.},

This equipment effectively combines the technologies of a high-power Yb:fiber laser, ultraviolet-driven harmonic generation in Xe gas, and a {SARPES} apparatus equipped with very-low-energy-electron-diffraction spin detectors. A high repetition rate (1¬†{MHz}) of the probe laser allows experiments with the photoemission space-charge effects significantly reduced, despite a high flux of 1013 photons/s on the sample. The relatively high photon energy (10.7¬†{eV}) also brings the capability of observing a wide momentum range that covers the entire Brillouin zone of many materials while ensuring high momentum resolution. The experimental setup overcomes the low efficiency of spin-resolved measurements, which gets even more severe for the pump-probed unoccupied states, and affords the opportunity to investigate ultrafast electron and spin dynamics of modern quantum materials with energy and time resolutions of 25¬†{meV} and 360¬†fs, respectively.},

Two different grating configurations are compared: the classical diffraction mount ({CDM}) and the off-plane mount ({OPM}). We shown that the {CDM} is preferred for single-grating monochromators with relatively long time responses, i.e., 100‚Äì200fs, while the {OPM} is suitable for ultrashort time responses in the 10‚Äì50fs range to realize femtosecond time-preserving monochromators.},

Discovering pathways to experimentally realize quantum phases of matter and exert control over their properties is a central goal of modern condensed-matter physics, which holds promise for a new generation of electronic/photonic devices with currently inaccessible and likely unimaginable functionalities. In this Review, we describe emerging strategies for selectively perturbing microscopic interaction parameters, which can be used to transform materials into a desired quantum state. Particular emphasis will be placed on recent successes to tailor electronic interaction parameters through the application of intense fields, impulsive electromagnetic stimulation, and nanostructuring or interface engineering.

However, ultrafast photoemission experiments using extreme-ultraviolet ({XUV}) light have previously been limited by either space-charge effects, low photon flux, or limited tuning range. In this article, we describe {XUV} photoelectron spectroscopy experiments with up to 5‚Äâ{nA} of average sample current using a tunable cavity-enhanced high-harmonic source operating at 88‚Äâ{MHz} repetition rate. The source delivers \&gt;1011 photons/s in isolated harmonics to the sample over a broad photon energy range from 18 to 37‚Äâ{eV} with a spot size of 58‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ100 Œºm2. From photoelectron spectroscopy data, we place conservative upper limits on the {XUV} pulse duration and photon energy bandwidth of 93 fs and 65‚Äâ{meV}, respectively. The high photocurrent, lack of strong space charge distortions of the photoelectron spectra, and excellent isolation of individual harmonic orders allow us to observe laser-induced modifications of the photoelectron spectra at the 10‚àí4 level, enabling time-resolved {XUV} photoemission experiments in a qualitatively new regime.},

We study the ultrafast evolution of this gap structure, uncovering a very rich landscape of decay rates as a function of angle, temperature, and energy. We explicitly focus on the quasiparticle states at the gap edge as well as on the spectral weight inside the gap that ‚Äúfills‚Äù the gap‚Äîunderstood as an interaction, or self-energy effect‚Äîand we also make high resolution measurements of the nodal states, enabling a direct and accurate measurement of the electronic temperature (or pseudotemperature) of the electrons in the system. Rather than the standard method of interpreting these results using individual quasiparticle scattering rates that vary significantly as a function of angle, temperature, and energy, we show that the entire landscape of relaxations can be understood by modeling the system as following a nonequilibrium, electronic pseudotemperature that controls all electrons in the zone. Furthermore, this model has zero free parameters, as we obtain the crucial information of the {SC} gap Œî and the gap-filling strength Œì{TDoS} by connecting to static {ARPES} measurements. The quantitative and qualitative agreement between data and model suggests that the critical parameters and interactions of the system, including the pairing interactions, follow parametrically from the electronic pseudotemperature. We expect that this concept will be relevant for understanding the ultrafast response of a great variety of electronic materials, even though the electronic pseudotemperature may not be directly measurable.},

	abstract = {In the last two decades non-equilibrium spectroscopies have evolved from avant-garde studies to crucial tools for expanding our understanding of the physics of strongly correlated materials. The possibility of obtaining simultaneously spectroscopic and temporal information has led to insights that are complementary to (and in several cases beyond) those attainable by studying the matter at equilibrium. From this perspective, multiple phase transitions and new orders arising from competing interactions are benchmark examples where the interplay among electrons, lattice and spin dynamics can be disentangled because of the different timescales that characterize the recovery of the initial ground state. For example, the nature of the broken-symmetry phases and of the bosonic excitations that mediate the electronic interactions, eventually leading to superconductivity or other exotic states, can be revealed by observing the sub-picosecond dynamics of impulsively excited states. Furthermore, recent experimental and theoretical developments have made it possible to monitor the time-evolution of both the single-particle and collective excitations under extreme conditions, such as those arising from strong and selective photo-stimulation. These developments are opening the way for new, non-equilibrium phenomena that can eventually be induced and manipulated by short laser pulses. Here, we review the most recent achievements in the experimental and theoretical studies of the non-equilibrium electronic, optical, structural and magnetic properties of correlated materials. The focus will be mainly on the prototypical case of correlated oxides that exhibit unconventional superconductivity or other exotic phases. The discussion will also extend to other topical systems, such as iron-based and organic superconductors, and charge-transfer insulators. With this review, the dramatically growing demand for novel experimental tools and theoretical methods, models and concepts, will clearly emerge. In particular, the necessity of extending the actual experimental capabilities and the numerical and analytic tools to microscopically treat the non-equilibrium phenomena beyond the simple phenomenological approaches represents one of the most challenging new frontiers in physics.},

This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity‚Äîwhich cannot be explained by weak electron‚Äìphonon interactions‚Äîin a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1¬∞‚Äîthe first ‚Äòmagic‚Äô angle‚Äîthe electronic band structure of this ‚Äòtwisted bilayer graphene‚Äô exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature‚Äìcarrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 1011 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

	abstract = {We report on the low-energy electronic structure of tantalum ditelluride (1T‚Ä≤-{TaTe}2), one of the charge density wave ({CDW}) materials from the group V transition metal dichalcogenides using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory ({DFT}). We find that the Fermi surface topology of {TaTe}2 is quite complicated compared to its isovalent compounds such as {TaS}2, {TaSe}2, and isostructural compound {NbTe}2. Most importantly, we discover that the surface electronic structure of 1T‚Ä≤-{TaTe}2 has more resemblance to the 2H-{TaTe}2, while the bulk electronic structure has more resemblance to the hypothetical 1T-{TaTe}2. These experimental observations are thoroughly compared with our {DFT} calculations performed on 1T-, 2H-, and 2H (monolayer)/1T-{TaTe}2. We further notice that the Fermi surface topology is temperature independent up to 180 K, confirming that the 2H phase on the surface is stable up to 180 K and the {CDW} order is not due to the Fermi surface nesting.},

In 1‚Å¢ùëá‚àí{TaTe}2, the double zigzag chain structure of Ta is deformed at about 170 K, and heptamer molecules are formed periodically at low temperatures. We found that some of the Ta atoms that compose the double zigzag chain structure appearing at high temperatures are locally displaced, resulting in local dimerization. This tendency weakens when Ta is replaced by V or Nb. Our results indicate that the local distortion persistently survives in these ditellurides, where the electronic degrees of freedom, including orbitals, are weakened. We further discuss the origin of local distortion in these ditellurides, which is different from many usual material systems where molecular formation occurs at low temperatures.},

	abstract = {Transition metal dichalcogenides host a wide variety of lattice and electronic structures, as well as corresponding exotic physical properties, especially under certain tuning conditions. Here, we report the observation of pressure-induced three superconducting transitions in {TaTe}2, a charge density wave ({CDW})‚Äìbearing layered transition-metal dichalcogenide that is metallic but not superconducting at ambient pressure. We find that its {CDW} state can be easily suppressed upon increasing pressure up to ‚àº1 {GPa}. A superconducting state then emerges from the suppressed {CDW} state and persists to the pressure about 7 {GPa}. Unexpectedly, another superconducting state appears at ‚àº11 {GPa} within the same monoclinic (M) structure of its ambient-pressure one. Upon further compression to 21 {GPa}, a third superconducting state with higher ùëáùëê appears from a high-pressure ({HP}) phase. Our experimental results suggest that the pressure-induced three superconducting transitions in {TaTe}2 are, respectively, driven by the suppression of the {CDW} state, the change of the Œ≤ angle in the M phase and the transition of M-to-{HP} phase. These results demonstrate not only the versatile nature of this correlated electron system, but also the first experimental example that shows the pressure-induced evolution from a {CDW} state to three superconducting states driven by different mechanisms.},

Based on the experimental and the calculation results, some interpretations are present. Firstly, abnormal redshifts of few Raman peaks are observed around the structural distortion temperature ùëáùëÜ‚àº170K, which is thought to originate from the clustering of Ta atoms below ùëáùëÜ. Secondly, new modes of Raman spectrum below ùëáùëÜ are present, which is suggested to be related to the possible transition of charge density wave ({CDW}) in {TaT}‚Å¢e2 from the room temperature to the low temperature. The ground state of the {TaT}‚Å¢e2 is the special charge modulation, which is related to the formation of Ta-Ta dimer structure at low temperature.

Here, using first-principles calculations, we investigate the polymorphs of monolayer 1‚Å¢ùëá‚àí{TaTe}2, including the high-symmetry phase and various charge density wave ({CDW}) phases (3√ó1, 4√ó1, 3√ó3, 2‚Å¢‚àö3√ó2‚Å¢‚àö3, ‚àö13√ó‚àö13, 4√ó4, and ‚àö19√ó‚àö19) with diverse physical properties. The high-symmetry 1‚Å¢ùëá phase is predicted to be a quantum anomalous Hall metal with ferromagnetism. However, after undergoing the {CDW} phase transitions, the ferromagnetism vanishes and the nontrivial topological properties are also altered. Particularly, the 4√ó4 {CDW} phase with the second lowest total energy exhibits a novel topological insulating state, while the 3√ó3 {CDW} phase, possessing the lowest total energy, behaves as a normal metal. We further propose that charge doping can effectively modulate the relative stability of the {CDW} phases. Upon introducing slight hole doping, the 4√ó4 {CDW} becomes the most energetically stable state followed by the 3√ó3 {CDW} phase. These findings show the rich landscape of structures and properties of 1‚Å¢ùëá‚àí{TaTe}2, which will strongly stimulate further investigations and lay the foundation for the development of new electronic devices.},

Here, the selective growth of monolayer {TaTe}2 films with different phases as well as superstructures using molecular beam epitaxy ({MBE}) is reported. Monolayer 1H-{TaTe}2 and 1T-{TaTe}2 films can be selectively controlled by varying the growth temperature, and their different electronic structures are revealed through the combination of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements ({ARPES}) and first-principles calculations. Moreover, post-growth annealing of the 1H-{TaTe}2 film further leads to a transition from a 19√ó19{\textbackslash}sqrt 19{\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}sqrt 19{\textbackslash} superstructure to a new 2 √ó 2 superstructure, where two gaps are observed in the electronic structure and persist up to room temperature. First-principles calculations reveal the role of the phonon instability in the formation of superstructures and the effect of local atomic distortions on the modified electronic structures.

This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter4,5, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schr√∂dinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon6,7) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective ‚Äòspeed of light‚Äô c* ‚âà 106‚Äâm‚Äâs-1. Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass mc of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = mcc*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment.},

	abstract = {This review discusses recent advances and future research priorities in the transition-metal dichalcogenide ({TMD}) field. While the community has witnessed tremendous advances through research conducted on two-dimensional (2D) {TMD} crystals, it is vital to seek new research opportunities beyond developed areas. To this end, in this review we focus principally on articulating areas of need in the preparation and analysis of {TMD} crystals encompassing dimensionalities and morphologies beyond 2D. Ultimately, the development of new synthetic methods to control key structural features of low-dimensional {TMD} crystals (e.g., dimensionality, morphology, and phase) will afford access to a broader range of breakthrough properties for this intriguing material class. We begin with a brief overview of the evolution of 2D {TMD} research, discussing both the synthetic methods that have enabled the preparation of these materials and the manifold properties they possess. We focus the bulk of our review on discussion of recent advances associated with 1D {TMD} crystals, which are often referred to as {TMD} nanoribbons, and include a discussion of recent efforts in 0D systems. We discuss synthetic strategies that have been developed to prepare such beyond 2D crystals and highlight their unique physical and chemical properties. After reviewing the host of analytical tools available for characterization of {TMD} materials, we identify future analytical instrumentation needs. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects of beyond 2D {TMD} crystals in optoelectronics, catalysis, and quantum information science.},

	abstract = {When electrons are confined in two-dimensional materials, quantum-mechanically enhanced transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect can be observed. Graphene, consisting of an isolated single atomic layer of graphite, is an ideal realization of such a two-dimensional system. However, its behaviour is expected to differ markedly from the well-studied case of quantum wells in conventional semiconductor interfaces. This difference arises from the unique electronic properties of graphene, which exhibits electron‚Äìhole degeneracy and vanishing carrier mass near the point of charge neutrality1,2. Indeed, a distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect has been predicted3,4,5 theoretically, as has the existence of a non-zero Berry's phase (a geometric quantum phase) of the electron wavefunction‚Äîa consequence of the exceptional topology of the graphene band structure6,7. Recent advances in micromechanical extraction and fabrication techniques for graphite structures8,9,10,11,12 now permit such exotic two-dimensional electron systems to be probed experimentally. Here we report an experimental investigation of magneto-transport in a high-mobility single layer of graphene. Adjusting the chemical potential with the use of the electric field effect, we observe an unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect for both electron and hole carriers in graphene. The relevance of Berry's phase to these experiments is confirmed by magneto-oscillations. In addition to their purely scientific interest, these unusual quantum transport phenomena may lead to new applications in carbon-based electronic and magneto-electronic devices.},

	abstract = {The behaviour of strongly correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades, but is still not well understood. This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity‚Äîwhich cannot be explained by weak electron‚Äìphonon interactions‚Äîin a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1¬∞‚Äîthe first ‚Äòmagic‚Äô angle‚Äîthe electronic band structure of this ‚Äòtwisted bilayer graphene‚Äô exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature‚Äìcarrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 1011 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

Recently, it was predicted that a topologically protected Weyl semimetal phase in the transition metal dichalcogenide Td-{WTe}2 can be controlled and, ultimately, be destroyed upon the coherent excitation of an interlayer shear mode. By monitoring electronic structure changes with femtosecond resolution, we provide here direct experimental evidence that the shear mode acts on the electronic states near the phase-defining Weyl points. Furthermore, we observe a periodic reduction in the spin splitting of bands, a distinct electronic signature of the Weyl phase-stabilizing non-centrosymmetric Td ground state of {WTe}2. The comparison with higher-frequency coherent phonon modes finally proves the shear mode-selectivity of the observed changes in the electronic structure. Our real-time observations reveal direct experimental insights into electronic processes that are of vital importance for a coherent phonon-induced topological phase transition in¬†Td-{WTe}2.},

This field of research has experienced an impetuous growth in recent years, due to the technological progress in the generation of ultrashort light pulses and to the development of sophisticated spectroscopic techniques, which greatly increase the amount of information on the process under study. This paper aims at providing a non-exhaustive overview of the state of the art of the field and at pointing out future challenges. We first review the progress in ultrafast optics, which has enabled the generation of broadly tunable light pulses with duration down to a few optical cycles; we then discuss the pump‚Äìprobe technique, showing examples of its capability to combine very high time resolution, down to the attosecond regime, with broad spectral coverage; we introduce two-dimensional spectroscopy and present results that demonstrate the additional information content provided by the combination of temporal and spectral resolution. Next, we review the achievements of ultrafast X-ray and electron diffraction, which provide time-dependent structural information on photochemical processes, and we conclude with a critical analysis of the future open challenges in the field.},

	abstract = {In the last two decades non-equilibrium spectroscopies have evolved from avant-garde studies to crucial tools for expanding our understanding of the physics of strongly correlated materials. The possibility of obtaining simultaneously spectroscopic and temporal information has led to insights that are complementary to (and in several cases beyond) those attainable by studying the matter at equilibrium. From this perspective, multiple phase transitions and new orders arising from competing interactions are benchmark examples where the interplay among electrons, lattice and spin dynamics can be disentangled because of the different timescales that characterize the recovery of the initial ground state. For example, the nature of the broken-symmetry phases and of the bosonic excitations that mediate the electronic interactions, eventually leading to superconductivity or other exotic states, can be revealed by observing the sub-picosecond dynamics of impulsively excited states. Furthermore, recent experimental and theoretical developments have made it possible to monitor the time-evolution of both the single-particle and collective excitations under extreme conditions, such as those arising from strong and selective photo-stimulation. These developments are opening the way for new, non-equilibrium phenomena that can eventually be induced and manipulated by short laser pulses. Here, we review the most recent achievements in the experimental and theoretical studies of the non-equilibrium electronic, optical, structural and magnetic properties of correlated materials. The focus will be mainly on the prototypical case of correlated oxides that exhibit unconventional superconductivity or other exotic phases. The discussion will also extend to other topical systems, such as iron-based and organic superconductors, and charge-transfer insulators. With this review, the dramatically growing demand for novel experimental tools and theoretical methods, models and concepts, will clearly emerge. In particular, the necessity of extending the actual experimental capabilities and the numerical and analytic tools to microscopically treat the non-equilibrium phenomena beyond the simple phenomenological approaches represents one of the most challenging new frontiers in physics.},

Far from the nodes, pumping affected the gap only weakly, and recombination processes were faster. These results demonstrate a new window into the dynamical processes that govern quasiparticle recombination and gap formation in cuprates.},

	abstract = {The oxide superconductors, particularly those recently discovered that are based on La2CuO4, have a set of peculiarities that suggest a common, unique mechanism: they tend in every case to occur near a metal-insulator transition into an odd-electron insulator with peculiar magnetic properties. This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought "resonating-valence-bond" state or "quantum spin liquid" hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.},

	abstract = {High-harmonic generation is a well-known method of producing coherent extreme-ultraviolet ({EUV}) light, with photon energies up to about 0.5‚Äâ{keV} (refs 1, 2). This is achieved by focusing a femtosecond laser into a gas, and high harmonics of the fundamental laser frequency are radiated in the forward direction3,4. However, although this process can generate high-energy photons, efficient high-harmonic generation has been demonstrated only for photon energies of the order 50‚Äì100‚Äâ{eV} (ref. 5). Ionization of the gas prevents the laser and the {EUV} light from propagating at the same speed, which severely limits the conversion efficiency. Here we report a technique to overcome this problem, and demonstrate quasi-phase-matched frequency conversion of laser light into {EUV}. Using a modulated hollow-core waveguide to periodically vary the intensity of the laser light driving the conversion, we efficiently generate {EUV} light even in the presence of substantial ionization. The use of a modulated fibre shifts the energy spectrum of the high-harmonic light to significantly higher photon energies than would otherwise be possible. We expect that this technique could form the basis of coherent {EUV} sources for advanced lithography and high-resolution imaging applications. In future work, it might also be possible to generate isolated attosecond pulses.},

	abstract = {High harmonic generation ({HHG}) of intense infrared laser radiation (Ferray et al., J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 21:L31, 1988; {McPherson} et al., J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 4:595, 1987) enables coherent vacuum-{UV} ({VUV}) to soft-X-ray sources. In the usual setup, energetic femtosecond laser pulses are strongly focused into a gas jet, restricting the interaction length to the Rayleigh range of the focus. The average photon flux is limited by the low conversion efficiency and the low average power of the complex laser amplifier systems (Keller, Nature 424:831, 2003; S√ºdmeyer et al., Nat. Photonics 2:599, 2008; R√∂ser et al., Opt. Lett. 30:2754, 2005; Eidam et al., {IEEE} J. Sel. Top. Quantum Electron. 15:187, 2009) which typically operate at kilohertz repetition rates. This represents a severe limitation for many experiments using the harmonic radiation in fields such as metrology or high-resolution imaging. Driving {HHG} with novel high-power diode-pumped multi-megahertz laser systems has the potential to significantly increase the average photon flux. However, the higher average power comes at the expense of lower pulse energies because the repetition rate is increased by more than a thousand times, and efficient {HHG} is not possible in the usual geometry. So far, two promising techniques for {HHG} at lower pulse energies were developed: external build-up cavities (Gohle et al., Nature 436:234, 2005; Jones et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94:193, 2005) and resonant field enhancement in nanostructured targets (Kim et al., Nature 453:757, 2008). Here we present a third technique, which has advantages in terms of ease of {HHG} light extraction, transverse beam quality, and the possibility to substantially increase conversion efficiency by phase-matching (Paul et al., Nature 421:51, 2003; Ren et al., Opt. Express 16:17052, 2008; Serebryannikov et al., Phys. Rev. E (Stat. Nonlinear Soft Matter Phys.) 70:66611, 2004; Serebryannikov et al., Opt. Lett. 33:977, 2008; Zhang et al., Nat. Phys. 3:270, 2007). The interaction between the laser pulses and the gas occurs in a Kagome-type Hollow-Core Photonic Crystal Fiber ({HC}-{PCF}) (Benabid et al., Science 298:399, 2002), which reduces the detection threshold for {HHG} to only 200¬†{nJ}. This novel type of fiber guides nearly all of the light in the hollow core (Couny et al., Science 318:1118, 2007), preventing damage even at intensities required for {HHG}. Our fiber guided 30-fs pulses with a pulse energy of more than 10¬†ŒºJ, which is more than five times higher than for any other photonic crystal fiber (Hensley et al., Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics ({CLEO}), {IEEE} Press, New York, 2008).},

	abstract = {Modern ultrafast laser architectures enable high-order harmonic generation ({HHG}) in gases at (multi-) {MHz} repetition rates, where each atom interacts with multiple pulses before leaving the {HHG} volume. This raises the question of cumulative plasma effects on the nonlinear conversion. Utilizing a femtosecond enhancement cavity with {HHG} in argon and on-axis geometric extreme-ultraviolet ({XUV}) output coupling, we experimentally compare the single-pulse case with a double-pulse {HHG} regime in which each gas atom is hit by two pulses while traversing the interaction volume. By varying the pulse repetition rate (18.4 and 36.8 {MHz}) in an 18.4-{MHz} roundtrip-frequency cavity with a finesse of 187, and leaving all other pulse parameters identical (35-fs, 0.6-ŒºJ input pulses), we observe a dramatic decrease in the overall conversion efficiency (output-coupled power divided by the input power) in the double-pulse regime. The plateau harmonics (25‚Äì50 {eV}) exhibit very similar flux despite the twofold difference in repetition rate and average power. We attribute this to a spatially inhomogeneous plasma distribution that reduces the {HHG} volume, decreasing the generated {XUV} flux and/or affecting the spatial {XUV} beam profile, which reduces the efficiency of output coupling through the pierced mirror. These findings demonstrate the importance of cumulative plasma effects for power scaling of high-repetition-rate {HHG} in general and for applications in {XUV} frequency comb spectroscopy and in attosecond metrology in particular.},

In this article, we describe {XUV} photoelectron spectroscopy experiments with up to 5‚Äâ{nA} of average sample current using a tunable cavity-enhanced high-harmonic source operating at 88‚Äâ{MHz} repetition rate.

	abstract = {Sources of short wavelength radiation with femtosecond to attosecond pulse durations, such as synchrotrons or free electron lasers, have already made possible numerous, and will facilitate more, seminal studies aimed at understanding atomic and molecular processes on fundamental length and time scales. Table-top sources of coherent extreme ultraviolet to soft x-ray radiation enabled by high harmonic generation ({HHG}) of ultrashort pulse lasers have also gained significant attention in the last few years due to their enormous potential for addressing a plethora of applications, therefore constituting a complementary source to large-scale facilities (synchrotrons and free electron lasers). Ti:sapphire based laser systems have been the workhorses for {HHG} for decades, but are limited in repetition rate and average power. On the other hand, it has been widely recognized that fostering applications in fields such as photoelectron spectroscopy and microscopy, coincidence detection, coherent diffractive imaging and frequency metrology requires a high repetition rate and high photon flux {HHG} sources. In this article we will review recent developments in realizing the demanding requirement of producing a high photon flux and repetition rate at the same time. Particular emphasis will be put on suitable ultrashort pulse and high average power lasers, which directly drive harmonic generation without the need for external enhancement cavities. To this end we describe two complementary schemes that have been successfully employed for high power fiber lasers, i.e. optical parametric chirped pulse amplifiers and nonlinear pulse compression. Moreover, the issue of phase-matching in tight focusing geometries will be discussed and connected to recent experiments. We will highlight the latest results in fiber laser driven high harmonic generation that currently produce the highest photon flux of all existing sources. In addition, we demonstrate the first promising applications and discuss the future direction and challenges of this new type of {HHG} source.},

Their primary sources, mode-locked titanium-doped sapphire lasers and erbium/ytterbium-doped fibre lasers, deliver pulses with several nanojoules energy, which is insufficient for many important applications. Here we present the waveform-stabilized light source that is scalable to microjoule energy levels at the full (megahertz) repetition rate of the laser oscillator. A diode-pumped Kerr-lens-mode-locked Yb:{YAG} thin-disk laser combined with extracavity pulse compression yields waveform-stabilized few-cycle pulses (7.7‚Äâfs, 2.2 cycles) with a pulse energy of 0.15‚ÄâŒºJ and an average power of 6‚ÄâW. The demonstrated concept is scalable to pulse energies of several microjoules and near-gigawatt peak powers. The generation of attosecond pulses at the full repetition rate of the oscillator comes into reach. The presented system could serve as a primary source for frequency combs in the mid infrared and vacuum {UV} with unprecedented high power levels.},

A strong infrared pulse was then used to probe the ultrafast electronic and nuclear dynamics as the molecule exploded. We found that substantial fragmentation occurs through an electron-shakeup process, in which a second electron is simultaneously excited during the soft x-ray photoionization process. During fragmentation, the molecular potential seen by the electron changes rapidly from nearly spherically symmetric to a two-center molecular potential. Our approach can capture in real time and with angstrom resolution the influence of ionizing radiation on a range of molecular systems, probing dynamics that are inaccessible with the use of other techniques.},

The wide-ranging applicability and power of this approach are demonstrated by measurements on the two-dimensional semiconductor {WSe}2, where the energy-momentum dispersion of valence and conduction bands are observed in a single experiment. This provides a direct momentum-resolved view, not only on the complete out-of-equilibrium band gap but also on its renormalization induced by electronic screening.

	abstract = {Hybrid plasmonic devices involve a nanostructured metal supporting localized surface plasmons to amplify light‚Äìmatter interaction, and a non-plasmonic material to functionalize charge excitations. Application-relevant epitaxial heterostructures, however, give rise to ballistic ultrafast dynamics that challenge the conventional semiclassical understanding of unidirectional nanometal-to-substrate energy transfer. Epitaxial Au nanoislands are studied on {WSe}2 with time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and femtosecond electron diffraction: this combination of techniques resolves material, energy, and momentum of charge-carriers and phonons excited in the heterostructure. A strong non-linear plasmon‚Äìexciton interaction that transfers the energy of sub-bandgap photons very efficiently to the semiconductor is observed, leaving the metal cold until non-radiative exciton recombination heats the nanoparticles on hundreds of femtoseconds timescales. The results resolve a multi-directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal. Electron‚Äìphonon coupling and diffusive charge-transfer determine the subsequent energy flow. This complex dynamics opens perspectives for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications, while providing a constraining experimental testbed for state-of-the-art modelling.},

However, ultrafast photoemission experiments using extreme-ultraviolet ({XUV}) light have previously been limited by either space-charge effects, low photon flux, or limited tuning range. In this article, we describe {XUV} photoelectron spectroscopy experiments with up to 5‚Äâ{nA} of average sample current using a tunable cavity-enhanced high-harmonic source operating at 88‚Äâ{MHz} repetition rate. The source delivers \&gt;1011 photons/s in isolated harmonics to the sample over a broad photon energy range from 18 to 37‚Äâ{eV} with a spot size of 58‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ100 Œºm2. From photoelectron spectroscopy data, we place conservative upper limits on the {XUV} pulse duration and photon energy bandwidth of 93 fs and 65‚Äâ{meV}, respectively. The high photocurrent, lack of strong space charge distortions of the photoelectron spectra, and excellent isolation of individual harmonic orders allow us to observe laser-induced modifications of the photoelectron spectra at the 10‚àí4 level, enabling time-resolved {XUV} photoemission experiments in a qualitatively new regime.},

Especially when the photon pulses are intense, Coulombic repulsion between the emitted electrons will be a limiting factor for photoemission experiments aiming at highest energy and angle resolutions. In the present work, the propagation of the photoelectron cloud to the detector is studied with a full ùëÅ-body numerical simulation. The influence of various parameters, in particular number of electrons per pulse, source size, pulse duration, kinetic-energy and emission-angle distributions as well as presence of mirror charges in the sample, is investigated in detail. Previous experimental results obtained with various picosecond and femtosecond light sources are successfully reproduced and the general resolution limits of solid-state photoemission using pulsed photon sources are explored.

	abstract = {The fundamental mechanism responsible for optically induced magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic thin films has been under intense debate since almost two decades. Currently, numerous competing theoretical models are in strong need for a decisive experimental confirmation such as monitoring the triggered changes in the spin-dependent band structure on ultrashort time scales. Our approach explores the possibility of observing femtosecond band structure dynamics by giving access to extended parts of the Brillouin zone in a simultaneously time-, energy- and spin-resolved photoemission experiment. For this purpose, our setup uses a state-of-the-art, highly efficient spin detector and ultrashort, extreme ultraviolet light pulses created by laser-based high-order harmonic generation. In this paper, we present the setup and first spin-resolved spectra obtained with our experiment within an acquisition time short enough to allow pump-probe studies. Further, we characterize the influence of the excitation with femtosecond extreme ultraviolet pulses by comparing the results with data acquired using a continuous wave light source with similar photon energy. In addition, changes in the spectra induced by vacuum space-charge effects due to both the extreme ultraviolet probe- and near-infrared pump-pulses are studied by analyzing the resulting spectral distortions. The combination of energy resolution and electron count rate achieved in our setup confirms its suitability for spin-resolved studies of the band structure on ultrashort time scales.},

We investigate how the {XUV} energy spectra of photoelectrons are influenced by the space charge created due to ionization of the liquid medium by the pump laser pulse. {XUV} light from high-order harmonic generation is used to probe the electron population of the valence shell of iron hexacyanide in water. By exposing the sample to a short {UV} pump pulse of 266 nm wavelength and ‚àº55 fs duration, we observe an energy shift of the spectral component associated with {XUV} ionization from the Fe 3d(t2g) orbital as well as a shift of the water spectrum. Depending on the sequence of the pump and probe pulses, the arising energy shift of photoelectrons acquires a positive or negative value. It exhibits a sharp positive peak at small time delays, which facilitates to determine the temporal overlap between pump and probe pulses. The negative spectral shift is due to positive charge accumulated in the liquid medium during ionization. Its dissipation is found to occur on a (sub)nanosecond time scale and has a biexponential character. A simple mean-field model is provided to interpret the observations. A comparison between the intensity dependencies of the spectral shift and the {UV} ionization yield shows that the space-charge effect can be significantly reduced when the pump intensity is attenuated below the saturation level of water ionization. For the given experimental conditions, the saturation intensity lies at W cm‚àí2.},

Two different grating configurations are compared: the classical diffraction mount ({CDM}) and the off-plane mount ({OPM}).

	abstract = {Ultrafast electron diffraction is a powerful technique to investigate out-of-equilibrium atomic dynamics in solids with high temporal resolution. When diffraction is performed in reflection geometry, the main limitation is the mismatch in group velocity between the overlapping pump light and the electron probe pulses, which affects the overall temporal resolution of the experiment. A solution already available in the literature involved pulse front tilt of the pump beam at the sample, providing a sub-picosecond time resolution. However, in the reported optical scheme, the tilted pulse is characterized by a temporal chirp of about 1 ps at 1‚Äâmm away from the centre of the beam, which limits the investigation of surface dynamics in large crystals. In this paper, we propose an optimal tilting scheme designed for a radio-frequency-compressed ultrafast electron diffraction setup working in reflection geometry with 30‚Äâ{keV} electron pulses containing up to 105 electrons/pulse. To characterize our scheme, we performed optical cross-correlation measurements, obtaining an average temporal width of the tilted pulse lower than 250 fs. The calibration of the electron-laser temporal overlap was obtained by monitoring the spatial profile of the electron beam when interacting with the plasma optically induced at the apex of a copper needle (plasma lensing effect). Finally, we report the first time-resolved results obtained on graphite, where the electron-phonon coupling dynamics is observed, showing an overall temporal resolution in the sub-500 fs regime. The successful implementation of this configuration opens the way to directly probe structural dynamics of low-dimensional systems in the sub-picosecond regime, with pulsed electrons.},

Here we describe the optical layout of the pump-probe system, the means for separation of the high-order harmonics in the soft x-ray probe beam, including a description of the two grating setup used to compress the high-harmonic pulses and the magnetic bottle photoelectron spectrometer used for data collection. The feasibility of using the generated high-harmonic pulses for an array of gaseous phase photoelectron spectroscopy experiments is established. These include measurements of valence shell and core-level photoelectron transitions in atoms and molecules, the tunability of the soft x-ray harmonic through Rydberg resonances, and the energy bandwidths of the harmonics. Cross correlations between the visible/{UV} and soft x-ray pulses, by above threshold ionization, are used to establish the pulse timing, pulse duration, and spatial overlap for ultrafast studies. The observed real time photodissociation of Br2 serves as a demonstration of the pump-probe ultrafast technique and the applicability to ultrafast time-resolved chemical dynamics.},

The divergence of the beam is twice the diffraction limit, making the brightness of this source equal to approximately 2*10/sup +18/ W/(cm-sr), which is thought to be the highest brightness yet reported. The {CPA} technique allows the efficient energy extraction from extremely compact amplifier systems.

	abstract = {Non-linear interactions respond to instantaneous power rather than average power. For laser pulses, the peak instantaneous power is defined as the pulse energy over the pulse duration and so can be increased in one of two ways, increasing the energy or decreasing the pulse duration. Increasing the energy requires further amplification stages, which are necessarily larger to handle the higher energy. Chirped Pulse Amplification ({CPA}) solves the problem of how to get ultra-intense pulses to the application without any non-linear processes destroying the amplifier. The original {CPA} concept could deliver pulses with picosecond durations and so to reach beyond the terawatt peak power level already achieved with nanosecond pulses and kilojoule energies, required amplifying the picosecond pulses to greater than the 1 Joule (J) level. The Treacy grating compressor is the one standard optical element that is used in almost every {CPA} laser system.},

We review the physics of {HHG} with emphasis on the macroscopic aspects of the nonlinear interaction, discussing the influence of length of medium, pressure, and intensity of the driving laser on the {HHG} conversion efficiency. Efficient {HHG} can be realized over a large range of pressures and medium lengths, if these follow a certain hyperbolic equation. This explains the large versatility in gas target designs for efficient {HHG} and provides design guidance for future high-flux {XUV} sources.},

	title = {Spin polarization and attosecond time delay in photoemission from solids},
	url = {https://infoscience.epfl.ch/handle/20.500.14299/146180},
	abstract = {In the photoemission process electrons are emitted from a solid upon excitation with {UV} light. From the measurement of their energy and momentum, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ({ARPES}) allows to reconstruct the electronic properties of the solid.
In addition, in spin-resolved {ARPES} the spin polarization P of the electrons is measured while maintaining energy and momentum resolution of {ARPES}, required to probe a dispersive state of a solid.

The spin information is related to the spin polarization of the state under investigation, but can be modified during the photoemission process. Indeed, even when the electrons originate from a spin-degenerate initial state, they can acquire a finite P.
This effect, ultimately due to a symmetry breaking in the experiment, occurs when different channels in the matrix elements describing the transition coherently interfere.
In particular, P is related to the phase shift between the complex matrix elements associated to the interfering channels.

This phase shift is also closely related to another quantity: the Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith ({EWS}) time delay. Despite the fundamental difficulties to properly define the concept of time in quantum mechanics, the {EWS} time delay, introduced to describe the electron scattering process, can be adapted to study the chronoscopy of photoemission.
Nowadays, thanks to advances in laser technology, time-resolved spectroscopic techniques that reach attosecond resolution allow to measure relative {EWS} time delays between photoelectrons from different states.

In this Thesis, an alternative indirect way to probe the photoemission process in the attosecond domain without time-resolved laser techniques will be presented.
The link between P from dispersive states of a solid and the {EWS} time delay will be introduced.
An analytical model will be discussed, where the dependence of P with binding energy is related to the {EWS} time delay of photoemission as a scattering process and the {EWS} time delay between the interfering channels.

The first experimental determination of {EWS} time delays from dispersive states by {SARPES} will be also presented. Synchrotron radiation-based {SARPES} is the main technique used in this Thesis. 
Results for a single crystal of Cu(111) give {EWS} time delays of about 26 as for the free-electron-like sp bulk-derived band.
The P of the d bands and of the 3p core levels of copper is also investigated.
On the other hand, experiments on the strongly correlated cuprate superconductor {BSCCO}2212 show {EWS} time delays that are at least 3 times larger than in Cu(111).
A double polarization feature is observed for the dispersive states, likely related to self-energy corrections in the photoemission process.
Recent results on {BSCCO}2212 performed with laser-based {SARPES} will be also discussed.

The results presented in this Thesis pave the way for a qualitatively new kind of information accessible by the {SARPES} technique, which is complementary to attosecond-resolved spectroscopies.
The model presented sheds light on the spin polarization that is obtained by one-step model photoemission calculations, where the time information becomes also available.
This approach could help to advance in the understandings of the physics of materials of interests, in particular electronic correlations, but also to better interpret the spin information experimentally obtained in {SARPES}, as well as to describe the basics of the quantum mechanics of the photoemission process itself.},

The strong light localization in {NCHCFs} allows not to use the complicated photonic crystal cladding and to reduce the air mode interaction with silica glass elements of the cladding.

Antiresonance in the glass at the core boundary and a wavenumber mismatch between the core and cladding modes inhibit coupling between the modes and have led to remarkably low loss in negative curvature fibers. We also summarize recent advances in negative curvature fibers that improve the performance of the fibers, including negative curvature that increases confinement, gaps between tubes that increase confinement and bandwidth, additional tubes that decrease mode coupling, tube structures that suppress higher-order modes, nested tubes that increase guidance, and tube parameters that decrease bend loss. Recent applications of negative curvature fibers are also presented, including mid-infrared fiber lasers, micromachining, and surgical procedures.

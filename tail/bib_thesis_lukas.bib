	abstract = {Vacuum-ultraviolet ({VUV}) light is critical for the study of molecules and materials, but the generation of femtosecond pulses in the {VUV} region at high repetition rates has proven difficult. Here we demonstrate the efficient generation of {VUV} light at megahertz repetition rates using highly cascaded four-wave mixing processes in a negative-curvature hollow-core fiber. Both even- and odd-order harmonics are generated up to the 15th harmonic (69 nm, 18.0 {eV}), with high energy resolution of ‚àº40meV. In contrast to direct high harmonic generation, this highly cascaded harmonic generation process requires lower peak intensity and therefore can operate at higher repetition rates, driven by a robust ‚àº10W fiber-laser system in a compact setup. Additionally, we present numerical simulations that explore the fundamental capabilities and spatiotemporal dynamics of highly cascaded harmonic generation. This {VUV} source can enhance the capabilities of spectroscopies of molecular and quantum materials, such as photoionization mass spectrometry and time-, angle-, and spin-resolved photoemission.},

	abstract = {The formations of charge and lattice orders are generally coupled in charge density wave ({CDW}) materials and share identical order wave vectors. Although this situation is usually satisfied in a large class of two-dimensional materials, it falls short in describing the so-called {CDW}-like phase transition in layered tantalum ditelluride ({TaTe}2), accompanied by anomalous low temperature transport properties and a periodic lattice distortion ({PLD}). Here we combine angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and low energy electron diffraction to directly access the charge and lattice structures in 1‚Å¢ùëá-polytypic {TaTe}2 and study the anomalous phase transition. Our data reveal the presence of a surprising quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surface with nesting ({FSN}) condition, despite its van der Waals layered structure. We find that the wave vectors of the {FSN} and {PLD} are different, suggesting the decoupled formation between charge and lattice orders. These conditions are accompanied by rich footprints in band structure, including Fermi surface suppression, minigaps, and satellite bands. Our results suggest that {TaTe}2 manifests intrinsic mixed dimensionality between its electronic and lattice structure and that the {CDW}-like phase transition is likely governed by multiple mechanisms. Our work provides routes for forging unconventional {CDW} phases and charge-lattice entanglement that would otherwise not be available in materials with fixed dimensionality.},

	abstract = {Ultrafast optical switching of materials properties is of great relevance both for future technological applications as well as gaining fundamental physical insights to microscopic couplings and nonequilibrium phenomena. Transition-metal dichalcogenides ({TMDCs}) combine photo-sensitivity with strong correlations, furthering rich phase diagrams and enhanced tunability. Owing to its chemical composition, \$1{\textbackslash}textit\{T'\}-{\textbackslash}text\{{TaTe}\}\_2\$ exhibits an electronically and structurally unique set of charge-density waves ({CDWs}), featuring increased conductivity and a reduced prominence of amplitude modes. Compared to other charge-ordered {TMDCs}, only very few studies addressed the ultrafast response of this material to optical excitation. In particular, the question whether such unconventional properties translate to unusual quench dynamics remains largely unresolved. Here, we investigate the structural dynamics in \$1{\textbackslash}textit\{T'\}-{\textbackslash}text\{{TaTe}\}\_2\$ by means of ultrafast nanobeam electron diffraction. The experiments are carried out with a tailored sample design that allows for excitation at 2\${\textbackslash},\${MHz} repetition rate, higher than any structural phase transformation probed thus far. Harnessing the enhanced resolution and sensitivity of this approach, we reveal a strongly directional cooperative atomic motion during the one-dimensional quench of the low-temperature trimer lattice. These dynamics are completed within less than 500\${\textbackslash},\$fs, substantially faster than reported previously. In striking contrast, the periodic lattice distortion of the room-temperature phase is unusually robust against high-density electronic excitation. In conjunction with the known sensitivity of \$1{\textbackslash}textit\{T'\}-{\textbackslash}text\{{TaTe}\}\_2\$ to chemical doping, we thus expect the material to serve as a versatile platform for tunable structural control by optical stimuli.},

While multiple mechanisms including Fermi surface nesting and chemical bonding instabilities have been intensively discussed, the origin of this transition remains elusive. Here we investigate the electronic structure of single-crystalline {TaTe}2 with a particular focus on its modifications through the phase transition, by employing core-level and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with first-principles calculations. Temperature-dependent core-level spectroscopy demonstrates a splitting of the Ta 4‚Å¢ùëì core-level spectra through the phase transition indicative of the Ta-dominated electronic state reconstruction. Low-energy electronic state measurements further reveal an unusual kink-like band reconstruction occurring at the Brillouin zone boundary, which cannot be explained by Fermi surface nesting or band-folding effects. On the basis of the orbital-projected band calculations, this band reconstruction is mainly attributed to the modifications of specific Ta 5‚Å¢ùëë states, namely, the ùëëùëã‚Å¢ùëå orbitals (the ones elongating along the ribbon chains) at the center Ta sites of the ribbon chains.

Time resolution is accomplished by using pump‚Äêand‚Äêprobe technique and the photoemitted electrons are energy analyzed in a time‚Äêof‚Äêflight detector. In order to perform photoemission, the near‚Äêinfrared light from the titanium:sapphire laser is frequency up‚Äêconverted to the vacuum ultraviolet range. This is accomplished by using the high peak power pulses from the laser system to produce short‚Äêwavelength radiation by means of harmonic generation. The system described uses cascaded frequency doubling and tripling, reaching a photon energy close to 10 {eV}.},

Using a picosecond pulsed laser, photons of energy 10.5 {eV} are generated through higher harmonic generation in xenon. The high repetition rate of the light source, variable between 0.2 and 8 {MHz}, enables high photoelectron count rates and short acquisition times. By using a time-of-flight analyzer with angle-resolving capabilities, electrons emitted from the sample within a circular cone of up to ¬±15¬∞ can be collected. Hence, simultaneous acquisition of photoemission data for a complete area of the Brillouin zone is possible. The current photon energy enables bulk sensitive measurements, high angular resolution, and the resulting covered momentum space is large enough to enclose the entire Brillouin zone in cuprate high-Tc superconductors. Fermi edge measurements on polycrystalline Au shows an energy resolution better than 5 {meV}. Data from a test measurement of the Au(111) surface state are presented along with measurements of the Fermi surface of the high-Tc superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 + Œ¥ (Bi2212).},

	abstract = {Non-equilibrium topological phenomena can be induced in quantum many-body systems using time-periodic fields (for example, by laser or microwave illumination). This Review begins with the key principles underlying Floquet band engineering, wherein such fields are used to change the topological properties of a system‚Äôs single-particle spectrum. In contrast to equilibrium systems, non-trivial band structure topology in a driven many-body system does not guarantee that robust topological behaviour will be observed. In particular, periodically driven many-body systems tend to absorb energy from their driving fields and thereby tend to heat up. We survey various strategies for overcoming this challenge of heating and for obtaining new topological phenomena in this non-equilibrium setting. We describe how drive-induced topological edge states can be probed in the regime of mesoscopic transport, and three routes for observing topological phenomena beyond the mesoscopic regime: long-lived transient dynamics and prethermalization, disorder-induced many-body localization, and engineered couplings to external baths. We discuss the types of phenomena that can be explored in each of the regimes covered, and their experimental realizations in solid-state, cold atomic, and photonic systems.},

Historically, ultrafast extreme ultraviolet sources employing high-order harmonic generation ({HHG}) have required compromises that make it challenging to achieve a high energy resolution‚Äîwhich is highly desirable for many {TR}-{ARPES} studies‚Äîwhile producing high photon energies and a high photon flux. We address this challenge by performing {HHG} inside a femtosecond enhancement cavity, realizing a practical source for {TR}-{ARPES} that achieves a flux of over 1011 photons/s delivered to the sample, operates over a range of 8‚Äì40 {eV} with a repetition rate of 60 {MHz}.

Using high photon energies, they are able to study ultrafast dynamics at high momenta, at which some of the most interesting fundamental phenomena occur. Applying the technique to the charge density wave material 1T-{TiSe}2, they obtain stroboscopic images of the electronic band structure at high momentum and show that atomic-scale periodic long-scale order collapses on a surprisingly short timescale of 20 femtoseconds.

	abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on {HgTe}‚àï{CdTe} quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on Bi1‚àí{xSbx}, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are then discussed that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

	abstract = {Ultrafast light sources have become an indispensable tool to access and understand transient phenomenon in material science. However, a simple and easy-to-implement method for harmonic selection, with high transmission efficiency and pulse duration conservation, is still a challenge. Here we showcase and compare two approaches for selecting the desired harmonic from a high harmonic generation source while achieving the above goals. The first approach is the combination of extreme ultraviolet spherical mirrors with transmission filters and the second approach uses a normal-incidence spherical grating. Both solutions target time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with photon energies in the 10-20 {eV} range but are relevant for other experimental techniques as well. The two approaches for harmonic selection are characterized in terms of focusing quality, photon flux, and temporal broadening. It is demonstrated that a focusing grating is able to provide much higher transmission as compared to the mirror+filter approach (3.3 times higher for 10.8 {eV} and 12.9 times higher for 18.1 {eV}), with only a slight temporal broadening (6.8\&\#x0025; increase) and a somewhat larger spot size (\&\#x223C;30\&\#x0025; increase). Overall, our study establishes an experimental perspective on the trade-off between a single grating normal incidence monochromator design and the use of filters. As such, it provides a basis for selecting the most appropriate approach in various fields where an easy-to-implement harmonic selection from high harmonic generation is needed.},

Recent advances in electron microscopy enable the imaging of random photogenerated individual skyrmions. However, their deterministic and dynamical manipulation is hampered by the chaotic nature of such fluctuations and the intrinsically irreversible switching between different minima in the magnetic energy landscape. Here, we demonstrate a method to coherently control the rotation of a skyrmion crystal by discrete amounts at speeds which are much faster than previously observed. By employing circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulses with an energy below the band gap of the Mott insulator Cu2OSeO3, we excite a collective magnon mode via the inverse Faraday effect. This triggers coherent magnetic oscillations that directly control the rotation of a skyrmion crystal imaged by cryo-Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. The manipulation of topological order via ultrafast laser pulses shown here can be used to engineer fast spin-based logical devices.},

Here, we show that optical excitation of lattice vibrations can induce polar order. This metastable polar phase, observed up to temperatures exceeding 290 kelvin, persists for hours after the optical pump is interrupted.

	abstract = {With its tunable band-gap and its unique optical and electronic properties black phosphorus ({BP}) opens exciting opportunities for optoelectronic nanotechnology. The band-gap extends from the visible to the mid-infrared spectral range, as a function of sample thickness and external parameters such as electric field and pressure. This, combined with the saturable absorption and in-plane anisotropic optical properties, makes {BP} a versatile platform for realizing polarization-sensitive photodetectors and absorbers. Although its near-equilibrium properties have been intensively studied, the development of efficient ultrafast optical devices requires detailed knowledge of the temporal dynamics of the photoexcited hot-carriers. Here we address the electronic response of {BP} to an ultrafast laser excitation, by means of time-and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Following the optical excitation, we directly observe a shift of the valence band ({VB}) position, indicative of band-gap renormalization ({BGR}). Our data also show that the hole population in the {VB} relaxes with a characteristic time œÑ{VB} = 10.2 ¬± 1.0 ps, while the lifetime of the electrons accumulated at the minimum of the conduction band is œÑ{CB} = 1.9 ¬± 0.2 ps. The experimental results are well reproduced by ab initio calculations of the out-of-equilibrium electronic properties. Our study sets the reference for the ultrafast carrier dynamics in {BP} and demonstrates the material‚Äôs ultrafast {BGR}, which is promising for optoelectronic switches.},

In this layered van der Waals crystal, the ferromagnetic layers couple antiparallel to each other; atomically thin {MnBi}2Te4, however, becomes ferromagnetic when the sample has an odd number of septuple layers.

The robust axion insulator state occurs in zero magnetic field, over a wide magnetic-field range and at relatively high temperatures. Moreover, a moderate magnetic field drives a quantum phase transition from the axion insulator phase to a Chern insulator phase with zero longitudinal resistance and quantized Hall resistance h/e2, where h is Planck‚Äôs constant and e is electron charge.

Here, we report on the selective area growth of (Bi,Sb)2Te3 {TI} thin films and stencil lithography of superconductive Nb for a full in situ fabrication of S‚Äì{TI} hybrid devices via molecular-beam epitaxy. A dielectric capping layer was deposited as a final step to protect the delicate surfaces of the S‚Äì{TI} hybrids at ambient conditions. Transport experiments in as-prepared Josephson junctions show highly transparent S‚Äì{TI} interfaces and a missing first Shapiro step, which indicates the presence of Majorana bound states. To move from single junctions towards complex circuitry for future topological quantum computation architectures, we monolithically integrated two aligned hardmasks to the substrate prior to growth.

A strong infrared pulse was then used to probe the ultrafast electronic and nuclear dynamics as the molecule exploded. We found that substantial fragmentation occurs through an electron-shakeup process, in which a second electron is simultaneously excited during the soft x-ray photoionization process. During fragmentation, the molecular potential seen by the electron changes rapidly from nearly spherically symmetric to a two-center molecular potential. Our approach can capture in real time and with angstrom resolution the influence of ionizing radiation on a range of molecular systems, probing dynamics that are inaccessible with the use of other techniques.},

            In recent years, the notion of ‚ÄòQuantum Materials‚Äô has emerged as a powerful unifying concept across diverse fields of science and engineering, from condensed-matter and coldatom physics to materials science and quantum computing. Beyond traditional quantum materials such as unconventional superconductors, heavy fermions, and multiferroics, the field has significantly expanded to encompass topological quantum matter, two-dimensional materials and their van der Waals heterostructures, Moir√© materials, Floquet time crystals, as well as materials and devices for quantum computation with Majorana fermions. In this Roadmap collection we aim to capture a snapshot of the most recent developments in the field, and to identify outstanding challenges and emerging opportunities. The format of the Roadmap, whereby experts in each discipline share their viewpoint and articulate their vision for quantum materials, reflects the dynamic and multifaceted nature of this research area, and is meant to encourage exchanges and discussions across traditional disciplinary boundaries. It is our hope that this collective vision will contribute to sparking new fascinating questions and activities at the intersection of materials science, condensed matter physics, device engineering, and quantum information, and to shaping a clearer landscape of quantum materials science as a new frontier of interdisciplinary scientific inquiry. We stress that this article is not meant to be a fully comprehensive review but rather an up-to-date snapshot of different areas of research on quantum materials with a minimal number of references focusing on the latest developments.},

However, the fundamental nature of p* remains unclear, in particular regarding whether it marks a true quantum phase transition. Here we measure the specific heat C of the cuprates Eu-{LSCO} and Nd-{LSCO} at low temperature in magnetic fields large enough to suppress superconductivity, over a wide doping range2 that includes p*. As a function of doping, we find that Cel/T is strongly peaked at p*¬†(where Cel is the electronic contribution to C) and exhibits a log(1/T) dependence as temperature T tends to zero. These are the classic thermodynamic signatures of a quantum critical point3‚Äì5, as observed in heavy-fermion6 and iron-based7 superconductors at the point where their antiferromagnetic phase comes to an end. We conclude that the pseudogap phase of cuprates ends at a quantum critical point, the associated fluctuations of which are probably involved in d-wave pairing and the anomalous scattering of charge carriers.},

However, the full potential of this approach has not yet been achieved because, to date, high harmonics generated by 800nm wavelength Ti:Sapphire lasers required a trade-off between photon flux, energy and time resolution. Photoemission spectroscopy requires a quasi-monochromatic output, but dispersive optical elements that select a single harmonic can significantly reduce the photon flux and time resolution. Here we show that 400nm driven high harmonic extreme-ultraviolet {trARPES} is superior to using 800nm laser drivers since it eliminates the need for any spectral selection, thereby increasing photon flux and energy resolution to {\textless}150meV while preserving excellent time resolution of about 30fs.},

	abstract = {Time-resolved photoemission with ultrafast pump and probe pulses is an emerging technique with wide application potential. Real-time recording of nonequilibrium electronic processes, transient states in chemical reactions, or the interplay of electronic and structural dynamics offers fascinating opportunities for future research. Combining valence-band and core-level spectroscopy with photoelectron diffraction for electronic, chemical, and structural analyses requires few 10 fs soft X-ray pulses with some 10 {meV} spectral resolution, which are currently available at high repetition rate free-electron lasers. We have constructed and optimized a versatile setup commissioned at {FLASH}/{PG}2 that combines free-electron laser capabilities together with a multidimensional recording scheme for photoemission studies. We use a full-field imaging momentum microscope with time-of-flight energy recording as the detector for mapping of 3D band structures in (kx, ky, E) parameter space with unprecedented efficiency. Our instrument can image full surface Brillouin zones with up to 7 √Ö‚àí1 diameter in a binding-energy range of several {eV}, resolving about 2.5 √ó 105 data voxels simultaneously. Using the ultrafast excited state dynamics in the van der Waals semiconductor {WSe}2 measured at photon energies of 36.5 {eV} and 109.5 {eV}, we demonstrate an experimental energy resolution of 130 {meV}, a momentum resolution of 0.06 √Ö‚àí1, and a system response function of 150 fs.},

This equipment effectively combines the technologies of a high-power Yb:fiber laser, ultraviolet-driven harmonic generation in Xe gas, and a {SARPES} apparatus equipped with very-low-energy-electron-diffraction spin detectors. A high repetition rate (1¬†{MHz}) of the probe laser allows experiments with the photoemission space-charge effects significantly reduced, despite a high flux of 1013 photons/s on the sample. The relatively high photon energy (10.7¬†{eV}) also brings the capability of observing a wide momentum range that covers the entire Brillouin zone of many materials while ensuring high momentum resolution. The experimental setup overcomes the low efficiency of spin-resolved measurements, which gets even more severe for the pump-probed unoccupied states, and affords the opportunity to investigate ultrafast electron and spin dynamics of modern quantum materials with energy and time resolutions of 25¬†{meV} and 360¬†fs, respectively.},

Two different grating configurations are compared: the classical diffraction mount ({CDM}) and the off-plane mount ({OPM}). We shown that the {CDM} is preferred for single-grating monochromators with relatively long time responses, i.e., 100‚Äì200fs, while the {OPM} is suitable for ultrashort time responses in the 10‚Äì50fs range to realize femtosecond time-preserving monochromators.},

Discovering pathways to experimentally realize quantum phases of matter and exert control over their properties is a central goal of modern condensed-matter physics, which holds promise for a new generation of electronic/photonic devices with currently inaccessible and likely unimaginable functionalities. In this Review, we describe emerging strategies for selectively perturbing microscopic interaction parameters, which can be used to transform materials into a desired quantum state. Particular emphasis will be placed on recent successes to tailor electronic interaction parameters through the application of intense fields, impulsive electromagnetic stimulation, and nanostructuring or interface engineering.

However, ultrafast photoemission experiments using extreme-ultraviolet ({XUV}) light have previously been limited by either space-charge effects, low photon flux, or limited tuning range. In this article, we describe {XUV} photoelectron spectroscopy experiments with up to 5‚Äâ{nA} of average sample current using a tunable cavity-enhanced high-harmonic source operating at 88‚Äâ{MHz} repetition rate. The source delivers \&gt;1011 photons/s in isolated harmonics to the sample over a broad photon energy range from 18 to 37‚Äâ{eV} with a spot size of 58‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ100 Œºm2. From photoelectron spectroscopy data, we place conservative upper limits on the {XUV} pulse duration and photon energy bandwidth of 93 fs and 65‚Äâ{meV}, respectively. The high photocurrent, lack of strong space charge distortions of the photoelectron spectra, and excellent isolation of individual harmonic orders allow us to observe laser-induced modifications of the photoelectron spectra at the 10‚àí4 level, enabling time-resolved {XUV} photoemission experiments in a qualitatively new regime.},

We study the ultrafast evolution of this gap structure, uncovering a very rich landscape of decay rates as a function of angle, temperature, and energy. We explicitly focus on the quasiparticle states at the gap edge as well as on the spectral weight inside the gap that ‚Äúfills‚Äù the gap‚Äîunderstood as an interaction, or self-energy effect‚Äîand we also make high resolution measurements of the nodal states, enabling a direct and accurate measurement of the electronic temperature (or pseudotemperature) of the electrons in the system. Rather than the standard method of interpreting these results using individual quasiparticle scattering rates that vary significantly as a function of angle, temperature, and energy, we show that the entire landscape of relaxations can be understood by modeling the system as following a nonequilibrium, electronic pseudotemperature that controls all electrons in the zone. Furthermore, this model has zero free parameters, as we obtain the crucial information of the {SC} gap Œî and the gap-filling strength Œì{TDoS} by connecting to static {ARPES} measurements. The quantitative and qualitative agreement between data and model suggests that the critical parameters and interactions of the system, including the pairing interactions, follow parametrically from the electronic pseudotemperature. We expect that this concept will be relevant for understanding the ultrafast response of a great variety of electronic materials, even though the electronic pseudotemperature may not be directly measurable.},

	abstract = {In the last two decades non-equilibrium spectroscopies have evolved from avant-garde studies to crucial tools for expanding our understanding of the physics of strongly correlated materials. The possibility of obtaining simultaneously spectroscopic and temporal information has led to insights that are complementary to (and in several cases beyond) those attainable by studying the matter at equilibrium. From this perspective, multiple phase transitions and new orders arising from competing interactions are benchmark examples where the interplay among electrons, lattice and spin dynamics can be disentangled because of the different timescales that characterize the recovery of the initial ground state. For example, the nature of the broken-symmetry phases and of the bosonic excitations that mediate the electronic interactions, eventually leading to superconductivity or other exotic states, can be revealed by observing the sub-picosecond dynamics of impulsively excited states. Furthermore, recent experimental and theoretical developments have made it possible to monitor the time-evolution of both the single-particle and collective excitations under extreme conditions, such as those arising from strong and selective photo-stimulation. These developments are opening the way for new, non-equilibrium phenomena that can eventually be induced and manipulated by short laser pulses. Here, we review the most recent achievements in the experimental and theoretical studies of the non-equilibrium electronic, optical, structural and magnetic properties of correlated materials. The focus will be mainly on the prototypical case of correlated oxides that exhibit unconventional superconductivity or other exotic phases. The discussion will also extend to other topical systems, such as iron-based and organic superconductors, and charge-transfer insulators. With this review, the dramatically growing demand for novel experimental tools and theoretical methods, models and concepts, will clearly emerge. In particular, the necessity of extending the actual experimental capabilities and the numerical and analytic tools to microscopically treat the non-equilibrium phenomena beyond the simple phenomenological approaches represents one of the most challenging new frontiers in physics.},

This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity‚Äîwhich cannot be explained by weak electron‚Äìphonon interactions‚Äîin a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1¬∞‚Äîthe first ‚Äòmagic‚Äô angle‚Äîthe electronic band structure of this ‚Äòtwisted bilayer graphene‚Äô exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature‚Äìcarrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 1011 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

	abstract = {We report on the low-energy electronic structure of tantalum ditelluride (1T‚Ä≤-{TaTe}2), one of the charge density wave ({CDW}) materials from the group V transition metal dichalcogenides using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory ({DFT}). We find that the Fermi surface topology of {TaTe}2 is quite complicated compared to its isovalent compounds such as {TaS}2, {TaSe}2, and isostructural compound {NbTe}2. Most importantly, we discover that the surface electronic structure of 1T‚Ä≤-{TaTe}2 has more resemblance to the 2H-{TaTe}2, while the bulk electronic structure has more resemblance to the hypothetical 1T-{TaTe}2. These experimental observations are thoroughly compared with our {DFT} calculations performed on 1T-, 2H-, and 2H (monolayer)/1T-{TaTe}2. We further notice that the Fermi surface topology is temperature independent up to 180 K, confirming that the 2H phase on the surface is stable up to 180 K and the {CDW} order is not due to the Fermi surface nesting.},

In 1‚Å¢ùëá‚àí{TaTe}2, the double zigzag chain structure of Ta is deformed at about 170 K, and heptamer molecules are formed periodically at low temperatures. We found that some of the Ta atoms that compose the double zigzag chain structure appearing at high temperatures are locally displaced, resulting in local dimerization. This tendency weakens when Ta is replaced by V or Nb. Our results indicate that the local distortion persistently survives in these ditellurides, where the electronic degrees of freedom, including orbitals, are weakened. We further discuss the origin of local distortion in these ditellurides, which is different from many usual material systems where molecular formation occurs at low temperatures.},

	abstract = {Transition metal dichalcogenides host a wide variety of lattice and electronic structures, as well as corresponding exotic physical properties, especially under certain tuning conditions. Here, we report the observation of pressure-induced three superconducting transitions in {TaTe}2, a charge density wave ({CDW})‚Äìbearing layered transition-metal dichalcogenide that is metallic but not superconducting at ambient pressure. We find that its {CDW} state can be easily suppressed upon increasing pressure up to ‚àº1 {GPa}. A superconducting state then emerges from the suppressed {CDW} state and persists to the pressure about 7 {GPa}. Unexpectedly, another superconducting state appears at ‚àº11 {GPa} within the same monoclinic (M) structure of its ambient-pressure one. Upon further compression to 21 {GPa}, a third superconducting state with higher ùëáùëê appears from a high-pressure ({HP}) phase. Our experimental results suggest that the pressure-induced three superconducting transitions in {TaTe}2 are, respectively, driven by the suppression of the {CDW} state, the change of the Œ≤ angle in the M phase and the transition of M-to-{HP} phase. These results demonstrate not only the versatile nature of this correlated electron system, but also the first experimental example that shows the pressure-induced evolution from a {CDW} state to three superconducting states driven by different mechanisms.},

Based on the experimental and the calculation results, some interpretations are present. Firstly, abnormal redshifts of few Raman peaks are observed around the structural distortion temperature ùëáùëÜ‚àº170K, which is thought to originate from the clustering of Ta atoms below ùëáùëÜ. Secondly, new modes of Raman spectrum below ùëáùëÜ are present, which is suggested to be related to the possible transition of charge density wave ({CDW}) in {TaT}‚Å¢e2 from the room temperature to the low temperature. The ground state of the {TaT}‚Å¢e2 is the special charge modulation, which is related to the formation of Ta-Ta dimer structure at low temperature.

Here, using first-principles calculations, we investigate the polymorphs of monolayer 1‚Å¢ùëá‚àí{TaTe}2, including the high-symmetry phase and various charge density wave ({CDW}) phases (3√ó1, 4√ó1, 3√ó3, 2‚Å¢‚àö3√ó2‚Å¢‚àö3, ‚àö13√ó‚àö13, 4√ó4, and ‚àö19√ó‚àö19) with diverse physical properties. The high-symmetry 1‚Å¢ùëá phase is predicted to be a quantum anomalous Hall metal with ferromagnetism. However, after undergoing the {CDW} phase transitions, the ferromagnetism vanishes and the nontrivial topological properties are also altered. Particularly, the 4√ó4 {CDW} phase with the second lowest total energy exhibits a novel topological insulating state, while the 3√ó3 {CDW} phase, possessing the lowest total energy, behaves as a normal metal. We further propose that charge doping can effectively modulate the relative stability of the {CDW} phases. Upon introducing slight hole doping, the 4√ó4 {CDW} becomes the most energetically stable state followed by the 3√ó3 {CDW} phase. These findings show the rich landscape of structures and properties of 1‚Å¢ùëá‚àí{TaTe}2, which will strongly stimulate further investigations and lay the foundation for the development of new electronic devices.},

Here, the selective growth of monolayer {TaTe}2 films with different phases as well as superstructures using molecular beam epitaxy ({MBE}) is reported. Monolayer 1H-{TaTe}2 and 1T-{TaTe}2 films can be selectively controlled by varying the growth temperature, and their different electronic structures are revealed through the combination of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements ({ARPES}) and first-principles calculations. Moreover, post-growth annealing of the 1H-{TaTe}2 film further leads to a transition from a 19√ó19{\textbackslash}sqrt 19{\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}sqrt 19{\textbackslash} superstructure to a new 2 √ó 2 superstructure, where two gaps are observed in the electronic structure and persist up to room temperature. First-principles calculations reveal the role of the phonon instability in the formation of superstructures and the effect of local atomic distortions on the modified electronic structures.

This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter4,5, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schr√∂dinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon6,7) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective ‚Äòspeed of light‚Äô c* ‚âà 106‚Äâm‚Äâs-1. Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass mc of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = mcc*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment.},

	abstract = {This review discusses recent advances and future research priorities in the transition-metal dichalcogenide ({TMD}) field. While the community has witnessed tremendous advances through research conducted on two-dimensional (2D) {TMD} crystals, it is vital to seek new research opportunities beyond developed areas. To this end, in this review we focus principally on articulating areas of need in the preparation and analysis of {TMD} crystals encompassing dimensionalities and morphologies beyond 2D. Ultimately, the development of new synthetic methods to control key structural features of low-dimensional {TMD} crystals (e.g., dimensionality, morphology, and phase) will afford access to a broader range of breakthrough properties for this intriguing material class. We begin with a brief overview of the evolution of 2D {TMD} research, discussing both the synthetic methods that have enabled the preparation of these materials and the manifold properties they possess. We focus the bulk of our review on discussion of recent advances associated with 1D {TMD} crystals, which are often referred to as {TMD} nanoribbons, and include a discussion of recent efforts in 0D systems. We discuss synthetic strategies that have been developed to prepare such beyond 2D crystals and highlight their unique physical and chemical properties. After reviewing the host of analytical tools available for characterization of {TMD} materials, we identify future analytical instrumentation needs. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects of beyond 2D {TMD} crystals in optoelectronics, catalysis, and quantum information science.},

	abstract = {When electrons are confined in two-dimensional materials, quantum-mechanically enhanced transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect can be observed. Graphene, consisting of an isolated single atomic layer of graphite, is an ideal realization of such a two-dimensional system. However, its behaviour is expected to differ markedly from the well-studied case of quantum wells in conventional semiconductor interfaces. This difference arises from the unique electronic properties of graphene, which exhibits electron‚Äìhole degeneracy and vanishing carrier mass near the point of charge neutrality1,2. Indeed, a distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect has been predicted3,4,5 theoretically, as has the existence of a non-zero Berry's phase (a geometric quantum phase) of the electron wavefunction‚Äîa consequence of the exceptional topology of the graphene band structure6,7. Recent advances in micromechanical extraction and fabrication techniques for graphite structures8,9,10,11,12 now permit such exotic two-dimensional electron systems to be probed experimentally. Here we report an experimental investigation of magneto-transport in a high-mobility single layer of graphene. Adjusting the chemical potential with the use of the electric field effect, we observe an unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect for both electron and hole carriers in graphene. The relevance of Berry's phase to these experiments is confirmed by magneto-oscillations. In addition to their purely scientific interest, these unusual quantum transport phenomena may lead to new applications in carbon-based electronic and magneto-electronic devices.},

	abstract = {The behaviour of strongly correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades, but is still not well understood. This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity‚Äîwhich cannot be explained by weak electron‚Äìphonon interactions‚Äîin a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1¬∞‚Äîthe first ‚Äòmagic‚Äô angle‚Äîthe electronic band structure of this ‚Äòtwisted bilayer graphene‚Äô exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature‚Äìcarrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 1011 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

Recently, it was predicted that a topologically protected Weyl semimetal phase in the transition metal dichalcogenide Td-{WTe}2 can be controlled and, ultimately, be destroyed upon the coherent excitation of an interlayer shear mode. By monitoring electronic structure changes with femtosecond resolution, we provide here direct experimental evidence that the shear mode acts on the electronic states near the phase-defining Weyl points. Furthermore, we observe a periodic reduction in the spin splitting of bands, a distinct electronic signature of the Weyl phase-stabilizing non-centrosymmetric Td ground state of {WTe}2. The comparison with higher-frequency coherent phonon modes finally proves the shear mode-selectivity of the observed changes in the electronic structure. Our real-time observations reveal direct experimental insights into electronic processes that are of vital importance for a coherent phonon-induced topological phase transition in¬†Td-{WTe}2.},

This field of research has experienced an impetuous growth in recent years, due to the technological progress in the generation of ultrashort light pulses and to the development of sophisticated spectroscopic techniques, which greatly increase the amount of information on the process under study. This paper aims at providing a non-exhaustive overview of the state of the art of the field and at pointing out future challenges. We first review the progress in ultrafast optics, which has enabled the generation of broadly tunable light pulses with duration down to a few optical cycles; we then discuss the pump‚Äìprobe technique, showing examples of its capability to combine very high time resolution, down to the attosecond regime, with broad spectral coverage; we introduce two-dimensional spectroscopy and present results that demonstrate the additional information content provided by the combination of temporal and spectral resolution. Next, we review the achievements of ultrafast X-ray and electron diffraction, which provide time-dependent structural information on photochemical processes, and we conclude with a critical analysis of the future open challenges in the field.},

	abstract = {In the last two decades non-equilibrium spectroscopies have evolved from avant-garde studies to crucial tools for expanding our understanding of the physics of strongly correlated materials. The possibility of obtaining simultaneously spectroscopic and temporal information has led to insights that are complementary to (and in several cases beyond) those attainable by studying the matter at equilibrium. From this perspective, multiple phase transitions and new orders arising from competing interactions are benchmark examples where the interplay among electrons, lattice and spin dynamics can be disentangled because of the different timescales that characterize the recovery of the initial ground state. For example, the nature of the broken-symmetry phases and of the bosonic excitations that mediate the electronic interactions, eventually leading to superconductivity or other exotic states, can be revealed by observing the sub-picosecond dynamics of impulsively excited states. Furthermore, recent experimental and theoretical developments have made it possible to monitor the time-evolution of both the single-particle and collective excitations under extreme conditions, such as those arising from strong and selective photo-stimulation. These developments are opening the way for new, non-equilibrium phenomena that can eventually be induced and manipulated by short laser pulses. Here, we review the most recent achievements in the experimental and theoretical studies of the non-equilibrium electronic, optical, structural and magnetic properties of correlated materials. The focus will be mainly on the prototypical case of correlated oxides that exhibit unconventional superconductivity or other exotic phases. The discussion will also extend to other topical systems, such as iron-based and organic superconductors, and charge-transfer insulators. With this review, the dramatically growing demand for novel experimental tools and theoretical methods, models and concepts, will clearly emerge. In particular, the necessity of extending the actual experimental capabilities and the numerical and analytic tools to microscopically treat the non-equilibrium phenomena beyond the simple phenomenological approaches represents one of the most challenging new frontiers in physics.},

Far from the nodes, pumping affected the gap only weakly, and recombination processes were faster. These results demonstrate a new window into the dynamical processes that govern quasiparticle recombination and gap formation in cuprates.},

	abstract = {The oxide superconductors, particularly those recently discovered that are based on La2CuO4, have a set of peculiarities that suggest a common, unique mechanism: they tend in every case to occur near a metal-insulator transition into an odd-electron insulator with peculiar magnetic properties. This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought "resonating-valence-bond" state or "quantum spin liquid" hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.},

	abstract = {High-harmonic generation is a well-known method of producing coherent extreme-ultraviolet ({EUV}) light, with photon energies up to about 0.5‚Äâ{keV} (refs 1, 2). This is achieved by focusing a femtosecond laser into a gas, and high harmonics of the fundamental laser frequency are radiated in the forward direction3,4. However, although this process can generate high-energy photons, efficient high-harmonic generation has been demonstrated only for photon energies of the order 50‚Äì100‚Äâ{eV} (ref. 5). Ionization of the gas prevents the laser and the {EUV} light from propagating at the same speed, which severely limits the conversion efficiency. Here we report a technique to overcome this problem, and demonstrate quasi-phase-matched frequency conversion of laser light into {EUV}. Using a modulated hollow-core waveguide to periodically vary the intensity of the laser light driving the conversion, we efficiently generate {EUV} light even in the presence of substantial ionization. The use of a modulated fibre shifts the energy spectrum of the high-harmonic light to significantly higher photon energies than would otherwise be possible. We expect that this technique could form the basis of coherent {EUV} sources for advanced lithography and high-resolution imaging applications. In future work, it might also be possible to generate isolated attosecond pulses.},

	abstract = {High harmonic generation ({HHG}) of intense infrared laser radiation (Ferray et al., J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 21:L31, 1988; {McPherson} et al., J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 4:595, 1987) enables coherent vacuum-{UV} ({VUV}) to soft-X-ray sources. In the usual setup, energetic femtosecond laser pulses are strongly focused into a gas jet, restricting the interaction length to the Rayleigh range of the focus. The average photon flux is limited by the low conversion efficiency and the low average power of the complex laser amplifier systems (Keller, Nature 424:831, 2003; S√ºdmeyer et al., Nat. Photonics 2:599, 2008; R√∂ser et al., Opt. Lett. 30:2754, 2005; Eidam et al., {IEEE} J. Sel. Top. Quantum Electron. 15:187, 2009) which typically operate at kilohertz repetition rates. This represents a severe limitation for many experiments using the harmonic radiation in fields such as metrology or high-resolution imaging. Driving {HHG} with novel high-power diode-pumped multi-megahertz laser systems has the potential to significantly increase the average photon flux. However, the higher average power comes at the expense of lower pulse energies because the repetition rate is increased by more than a thousand times, and efficient {HHG} is not possible in the usual geometry. So far, two promising techniques for {HHG} at lower pulse energies were developed: external build-up cavities (Gohle et al., Nature 436:234, 2005; Jones et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94:193, 2005) and resonant field enhancement in nanostructured targets (Kim et al., Nature 453:757, 2008). Here we present a third technique, which has advantages in terms of ease of {HHG} light extraction, transverse beam quality, and the possibility to substantially increase conversion efficiency by phase-matching (Paul et al., Nature 421:51, 2003; Ren et al., Opt. Express 16:17052, 2008; Serebryannikov et al., Phys. Rev. E (Stat. Nonlinear Soft Matter Phys.) 70:66611, 2004; Serebryannikov et al., Opt. Lett. 33:977, 2008; Zhang et al., Nat. Phys. 3:270, 2007). The interaction between the laser pulses and the gas occurs in a Kagome-type Hollow-Core Photonic Crystal Fiber ({HC}-{PCF}) (Benabid et al., Science 298:399, 2002), which reduces the detection threshold for {HHG} to only 200¬†{nJ}. This novel type of fiber guides nearly all of the light in the hollow core (Couny et al., Science 318:1118, 2007), preventing damage even at intensities required for {HHG}. Our fiber guided 30-fs pulses with a pulse energy of more than 10¬†ŒºJ, which is more than five times higher than for any other photonic crystal fiber (Hensley et al., Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics ({CLEO}), {IEEE} Press, New York, 2008).},

	abstract = {Modern ultrafast laser architectures enable high-order harmonic generation ({HHG}) in gases at (multi-) {MHz} repetition rates, where each atom interacts with multiple pulses before leaving the {HHG} volume. This raises the question of cumulative plasma effects on the nonlinear conversion. Utilizing a femtosecond enhancement cavity with {HHG} in argon and on-axis geometric extreme-ultraviolet ({XUV}) output coupling, we experimentally compare the single-pulse case with a double-pulse {HHG} regime in which each gas atom is hit by two pulses while traversing the interaction volume. By varying the pulse repetition rate (18.4 and 36.8 {MHz}) in an 18.4-{MHz} roundtrip-frequency cavity with a finesse of 187, and leaving all other pulse parameters identical (35-fs, 0.6-ŒºJ input pulses), we observe a dramatic decrease in the overall conversion efficiency (output-coupled power divided by the input power) in the double-pulse regime. The plateau harmonics (25‚Äì50 {eV}) exhibit very similar flux despite the twofold difference in repetition rate and average power. We attribute this to a spatially inhomogeneous plasma distribution that reduces the {HHG} volume, decreasing the generated {XUV} flux and/or affecting the spatial {XUV} beam profile, which reduces the efficiency of output coupling through the pierced mirror. These findings demonstrate the importance of cumulative plasma effects for power scaling of high-repetition-rate {HHG} in general and for applications in {XUV} frequency comb spectroscopy and in attosecond metrology in particular.},

In this article, we describe {XUV} photoelectron spectroscopy experiments with up to 5‚Äâ{nA} of average sample current using a tunable cavity-enhanced high-harmonic source operating at 88‚Äâ{MHz} repetition rate.

	abstract = {Sources of short wavelength radiation with femtosecond to attosecond pulse durations, such as synchrotrons or free electron lasers, have already made possible numerous, and will facilitate more, seminal studies aimed at understanding atomic and molecular processes on fundamental length and time scales. Table-top sources of coherent extreme ultraviolet to soft x-ray radiation enabled by high harmonic generation ({HHG}) of ultrashort pulse lasers have also gained significant attention in the last few years due to their enormous potential for addressing a plethora of applications, therefore constituting a complementary source to large-scale facilities (synchrotrons and free electron lasers). Ti:sapphire based laser systems have been the workhorses for {HHG} for decades, but are limited in repetition rate and average power. On the other hand, it has been widely recognized that fostering applications in fields such as photoelectron spectroscopy and microscopy, coincidence detection, coherent diffractive imaging and frequency metrology requires a high repetition rate and high photon flux {HHG} sources. In this article we will review recent developments in realizing the demanding requirement of producing a high photon flux and repetition rate at the same time. Particular emphasis will be put on suitable ultrashort pulse and high average power lasers, which directly drive harmonic generation without the need for external enhancement cavities. To this end we describe two complementary schemes that have been successfully employed for high power fiber lasers, i.e. optical parametric chirped pulse amplifiers and nonlinear pulse compression. Moreover, the issue of phase-matching in tight focusing geometries will be discussed and connected to recent experiments. We will highlight the latest results in fiber laser driven high harmonic generation that currently produce the highest photon flux of all existing sources. In addition, we demonstrate the first promising applications and discuss the future direction and challenges of this new type of {HHG} source.},

Their primary sources, mode-locked titanium-doped sapphire lasers and erbium/ytterbium-doped fibre lasers, deliver pulses with several nanojoules energy, which is insufficient for many important applications. Here we present the waveform-stabilized light source that is scalable to microjoule energy levels at the full (megahertz) repetition rate of the laser oscillator. A diode-pumped Kerr-lens-mode-locked Yb:{YAG} thin-disk laser combined with extracavity pulse compression yields waveform-stabilized few-cycle pulses (7.7‚Äâfs, 2.2 cycles) with a pulse energy of 0.15‚ÄâŒºJ and an average power of 6‚ÄâW. The demonstrated concept is scalable to pulse energies of several microjoules and near-gigawatt peak powers. The generation of attosecond pulses at the full repetition rate of the oscillator comes into reach. The presented system could serve as a primary source for frequency combs in the mid infrared and vacuum {UV} with unprecedented high power levels.},

A strong infrared pulse was then used to probe the ultrafast electronic and nuclear dynamics as the molecule exploded. We found that substantial fragmentation occurs through an electron-shakeup process, in which a second electron is simultaneously excited during the soft x-ray photoionization process. During fragmentation, the molecular potential seen by the electron changes rapidly from nearly spherically symmetric to a two-center molecular potential. Our approach can capture in real time and with angstrom resolution the influence of ionizing radiation on a range of molecular systems, probing dynamics that are inaccessible with the use of other techniques.},

The wide-ranging applicability and power of this approach are demonstrated by measurements on the two-dimensional semiconductor {WSe}2, where the energy-momentum dispersion of valence and conduction bands are observed in a single experiment. This provides a direct momentum-resolved view, not only on the complete out-of-equilibrium band gap but also on its renormalization induced by electronic screening.

	abstract = {Hybrid plasmonic devices involve a nanostructured metal supporting localized surface plasmons to amplify light‚Äìmatter interaction, and a non-plasmonic material to functionalize charge excitations. Application-relevant epitaxial heterostructures, however, give rise to ballistic ultrafast dynamics that challenge the conventional semiclassical understanding of unidirectional nanometal-to-substrate energy transfer. Epitaxial Au nanoislands are studied on {WSe}2 with time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and femtosecond electron diffraction: this combination of techniques resolves material, energy, and momentum of charge-carriers and phonons excited in the heterostructure. A strong non-linear plasmon‚Äìexciton interaction that transfers the energy of sub-bandgap photons very efficiently to the semiconductor is observed, leaving the metal cold until non-radiative exciton recombination heats the nanoparticles on hundreds of femtoseconds timescales. The results resolve a multi-directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal. Electron‚Äìphonon coupling and diffusive charge-transfer determine the subsequent energy flow. This complex dynamics opens perspectives for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications, while providing a constraining experimental testbed for state-of-the-art modelling.},

However, ultrafast photoemission experiments using extreme-ultraviolet ({XUV}) light have previously been limited by either space-charge effects, low photon flux, or limited tuning range. In this article, we describe {XUV} photoelectron spectroscopy experiments with up to 5‚Äâ{nA} of average sample current using a tunable cavity-enhanced high-harmonic source operating at 88‚Äâ{MHz} repetition rate. The source delivers \&gt;1011 photons/s in isolated harmonics to the sample over a broad photon energy range from 18 to 37‚Äâ{eV} with a spot size of 58‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ100 Œºm2. From photoelectron spectroscopy data, we place conservative upper limits on the {XUV} pulse duration and photon energy bandwidth of 93 fs and 65‚Äâ{meV}, respectively. The high photocurrent, lack of strong space charge distortions of the photoelectron spectra, and excellent isolation of individual harmonic orders allow us to observe laser-induced modifications of the photoelectron spectra at the 10‚àí4 level, enabling time-resolved {XUV} photoemission experiments in a qualitatively new regime.},

Especially when the photon pulses are intense, Coulombic repulsion between the emitted electrons will be a limiting factor for photoemission experiments aiming at highest energy and angle resolutions. In the present work, the propagation of the photoelectron cloud to the detector is studied with a full ùëÅ-body numerical simulation. The influence of various parameters, in particular number of electrons per pulse, source size, pulse duration, kinetic-energy and emission-angle distributions as well as presence of mirror charges in the sample, is investigated in detail. Previous experimental results obtained with various picosecond and femtosecond light sources are successfully reproduced and the general resolution limits of solid-state photoemission using pulsed photon sources are explored.

	abstract = {The fundamental mechanism responsible for optically induced magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic thin films has been under intense debate since almost two decades. Currently, numerous competing theoretical models are in strong need for a decisive experimental confirmation such as monitoring the triggered changes in the spin-dependent band structure on ultrashort time scales. Our approach explores the possibility of observing femtosecond band structure dynamics by giving access to extended parts of the Brillouin zone in a simultaneously time-, energy- and spin-resolved photoemission experiment. For this purpose, our setup uses a state-of-the-art, highly efficient spin detector and ultrashort, extreme ultraviolet light pulses created by laser-based high-order harmonic generation. In this paper, we present the setup and first spin-resolved spectra obtained with our experiment within an acquisition time short enough to allow pump-probe studies. Further, we characterize the influence of the excitation with femtosecond extreme ultraviolet pulses by comparing the results with data acquired using a continuous wave light source with similar photon energy. In addition, changes in the spectra induced by vacuum space-charge effects due to both the extreme ultraviolet probe- and near-infrared pump-pulses are studied by analyzing the resulting spectral distortions. The combination of energy resolution and electron count rate achieved in our setup confirms its suitability for spin-resolved studies of the band structure on ultrashort time scales.},

We investigate how the {XUV} energy spectra of photoelectrons are influenced by the space charge created due to ionization of the liquid medium by the pump laser pulse. {XUV} light from high-order harmonic generation is used to probe the electron population of the valence shell of iron hexacyanide in water. By exposing the sample to a short {UV} pump pulse of 266 nm wavelength and ‚àº55 fs duration, we observe an energy shift of the spectral component associated with {XUV} ionization from the Fe 3d(t2g) orbital as well as a shift of the water spectrum. Depending on the sequence of the pump and probe pulses, the arising energy shift of photoelectrons acquires a positive or negative value. It exhibits a sharp positive peak at small time delays, which facilitates to determine the temporal overlap between pump and probe pulses. The negative spectral shift is due to positive charge accumulated in the liquid medium during ionization. Its dissipation is found to occur on a (sub)nanosecond time scale and has a biexponential character. A simple mean-field model is provided to interpret the observations. A comparison between the intensity dependencies of the spectral shift and the {UV} ionization yield shows that the space-charge effect can be significantly reduced when the pump intensity is attenuated below the saturation level of water ionization. For the given experimental conditions, the saturation intensity lies at W cm‚àí2.},

Two different grating configurations are compared: the classical diffraction mount ({CDM}) and the off-plane mount ({OPM}).

	abstract = {Ultrafast electron diffraction is a powerful technique to investigate out-of-equilibrium atomic dynamics in solids with high temporal resolution. When diffraction is performed in reflection geometry, the main limitation is the mismatch in group velocity between the overlapping pump light and the electron probe pulses, which affects the overall temporal resolution of the experiment. A solution already available in the literature involved pulse front tilt of the pump beam at the sample, providing a sub-picosecond time resolution. However, in the reported optical scheme, the tilted pulse is characterized by a temporal chirp of about 1 ps at 1‚Äâmm away from the centre of the beam, which limits the investigation of surface dynamics in large crystals. In this paper, we propose an optimal tilting scheme designed for a radio-frequency-compressed ultrafast electron diffraction setup working in reflection geometry with 30‚Äâ{keV} electron pulses containing up to 105 electrons/pulse. To characterize our scheme, we performed optical cross-correlation measurements, obtaining an average temporal width of the tilted pulse lower than 250 fs. The calibration of the electron-laser temporal overlap was obtained by monitoring the spatial profile of the electron beam when interacting with the plasma optically induced at the apex of a copper needle (plasma lensing effect). Finally, we report the first time-resolved results obtained on graphite, where the electron-phonon coupling dynamics is observed, showing an overall temporal resolution in the sub-500 fs regime. The successful implementation of this configuration opens the way to directly probe structural dynamics of low-dimensional systems in the sub-picosecond regime, with pulsed electrons.},

Here we describe the optical layout of the pump-probe system, the means for separation of the high-order harmonics in the soft x-ray probe beam, including a description of the two grating setup used to compress the high-harmonic pulses and the magnetic bottle photoelectron spectrometer used for data collection. The feasibility of using the generated high-harmonic pulses for an array of gaseous phase photoelectron spectroscopy experiments is established. These include measurements of valence shell and core-level photoelectron transitions in atoms and molecules, the tunability of the soft x-ray harmonic through Rydberg resonances, and the energy bandwidths of the harmonics. Cross correlations between the visible/{UV} and soft x-ray pulses, by above threshold ionization, are used to establish the pulse timing, pulse duration, and spatial overlap for ultrafast studies. The observed real time photodissociation of Br2 serves as a demonstration of the pump-probe ultrafast technique and the applicability to ultrafast time-resolved chemical dynamics.},

	abstract = {Non-linear interactions respond to instantaneous power rather than average power. For laser pulses, the peak instantaneous power is defined as the pulse energy over the pulse duration and so can be increased in one of two ways, increasing the energy or decreasing the pulse duration. Increasing the energy requires further amplification stages, which are necessarily larger to handle the higher energy. Chirped Pulse Amplification ({CPA}) solves the problem of how to get ultra-intense pulses to the application without any non-linear processes destroying the amplifier. The original {CPA} concept could deliver pulses with picosecond durations and so to reach beyond the terawatt peak power level already achieved with nanosecond pulses and kilojoule energies, required amplifying the picosecond pulses to greater than the 1 Joule (J) level. The Treacy grating compressor is the one standard optical element that is used in almost every {CPA} laser system.},

Efficient {HHG} can be realized over a large range of pressures and medium lengths, if these follow a certain hyperbolic equation.

	title = {Spin polarization and attosecond time delay in photoemission from solids},
	url = {https://infoscience.epfl.ch/handle/20.500.14299/146180},
	abstract = {In the photoemission process electrons are emitted from a solid upon excitation with {UV} light. From the measurement of their energy and momentum, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ({ARPES}) allows to reconstruct the electronic properties of the solid.
In addition, in spin-resolved {ARPES} the spin polarization P of the electrons is measured while maintaining energy and momentum resolution of {ARPES}, required to probe a dispersive state of a solid.

The spin information is related to the spin polarization of the state under investigation, but can be modified during the photoemission process. Indeed, even when the electrons originate from a spin-degenerate initial state, they can acquire a finite P.
This effect, ultimately due to a symmetry breaking in the experiment, occurs when different channels in the matrix elements describing the transition coherently interfere.
In particular, P is related to the phase shift between the complex matrix elements associated to the interfering channels.

This phase shift is also closely related to another quantity: the Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith ({EWS}) time delay. Despite the fundamental difficulties to properly define the concept of time in quantum mechanics, the {EWS} time delay, introduced to describe the electron scattering process, can be adapted to study the chronoscopy of photoemission.
Nowadays, thanks to advances in laser technology, time-resolved spectroscopic techniques that reach attosecond resolution allow to measure relative {EWS} time delays between photoelectrons from different states.

In this Thesis, an alternative indirect way to probe the photoemission process in the attosecond domain without time-resolved laser techniques will be presented.
The link between P from dispersive states of a solid and the {EWS} time delay will be introduced.
An analytical model will be discussed, where the dependence of P with binding energy is related to the {EWS} time delay of photoemission as a scattering process and the {EWS} time delay between the interfering channels.

The first experimental determination of {EWS} time delays from dispersive states by {SARPES} will be also presented. Synchrotron radiation-based {SARPES} is the main technique used in this Thesis. 
Results for a single crystal of Cu(111) give {EWS} time delays of about 26 as for the free-electron-like sp bulk-derived band.
The P of the d bands and of the 3p core levels of copper is also investigated.
On the other hand, experiments on the strongly correlated cuprate superconductor {BSCCO}2212 show {EWS} time delays that are at least 3 times larger than in Cu(111).
A double polarization feature is observed for the dispersive states, likely related to self-energy corrections in the photoemission process.
Recent results on {BSCCO}2212 performed with laser-based {SARPES} will be also discussed.

The results presented in this Thesis pave the way for a qualitatively new kind of information accessible by the {SARPES} technique, which is complementary to attosecond-resolved spectroscopies.
The model presented sheds light on the spin polarization that is obtained by one-step model photoemission calculations, where the time information becomes also available.
This approach could help to advance in the understandings of the physics of materials of interests, in particular electronic correlations, but also to better interpret the spin information experimentally obtained in {SARPES}, as well as to describe the basics of the quantum mechanics of the photoemission process itself.},

	abstract = {The concept of a charge density wave ({CDW}), which is induced by Fermi-surface nesting, originated from the Peierls idea of electronic instabilities in purely one-dimensional metals and is now often applied to charge ordering in real low-dimensional materials. The idea is that if Fermi surface contours coincide when shifted along the observed {CDW} wave vector, then the {CDW} is considered to be nesting derived. We show that, in most cases, this procedure has no predictive power, since Fermi surfaces either do not nest at the right wave vector or nest more strongly at the wrong vector. We argue that only a tiny fraction, if any, of the observed charge ordering phase transitions are true analogs of the Peierls instability because electronic instabilities are easily destroyed by even small deviations from perfect nesting conditions. By using prototypical {CDW} materials {NbSe}2, {TaSe}2, and {CeTe}3, we show that such conditions are hardly ever fulfilled and that the {CDW} phases are actually structural phase transitions driven by the concerted action of electronic and ionic subsystems, i.e., a ùê™-dependent electron-phonon coupling plays an indispensable part. We also mathematically show that the original Peierls construction is so fragile that it is unlikely to apply to real materials. We argue that no meaningful distinction between a {CDW} and an incommensurate lattice transition exists.},

	abstract = {The charge density wave ({CDW}) instability, usually occurring in low-dimensional metals, has been a topic of interest for longtime. However, some very fundamental aspects of the mechanism remain unclear. Recently, a plethora of new {CDW} materials, a substantial fraction of which is two-dimensional or even three-dimensional, has been prepared and characterised as bulk and/or single-layers. As a result, the need for revisiting the primary mechanism of the instability, based on the electron‚Äìhole instability established more than 50 years ago for quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) conductors, has clearly emerged. In this work, we consider a large number of {CDW} materials to revisit the main concepts used in understanding the {CDW} instability, and emphasise the key role of the momentum dependent electron‚Äìphonon coupling in linking electronic and structural degrees of freedom. We argue that for quasi-1D systems, earlier weak coupling theories work appropriately and the energy gain due to the {CDW} and the concomitant periodic lattice distortion ({PLD}) remains primarily due to a Fermi surface nesting mechanism. However, for materials with higher dimensionality, intermediate and strong coupling regimes are generally at work and the modification of the chemical bonding network by the {PLD} is at the heart of the instability. We emphasise the need for a microscopic approach blending condensed matter physics concepts and state-of-the-art first-principles calculations with quite fundamental chemical bonding ideas in understanding the {CDW} phenomenon in these materials.},

This conventional theory leads to gross inconsistencies in attempting to fit the experimental data for 2‚Å¢ùêª‚àíTa‚Å¢Se2. The theory is reformulated, assuming that the coherence length is very short and that the dominant entropy is the lattice entropy. The lattice-entropy model is in good agreement with experiment at the semiquantitative level; the quantitative discrepancies appear to be due in part to the neglect of critical fluctuation effects.},

In the {CdI}2-type tellurides, the top portion of the Tep-block bands overlaps significantly with the bottom portion of the metal d-block bands, thereby causing a substantial electron transfer from the p- to the d-block bands. For this p ‚Üí d electron transfer, the interlayer Te¬∑¬∑¬∑Te contacts are found to be essential because the overlap between the Tepz-orbitals (perpendicular to the layer) associated with the interlayer Te¬∑¬∑¬∑Te contacts is most effective in raising the top portion of the Tep-block bands. As a consequence, layered transition-metal tellurides are likely to possess a three-dimensional metallic character, and a slight change in their interlayer Te¬∑¬∑¬∑Te contacts significantly affects their electrical and other physical properties.},

	abstract = {The formation of charge density wave ({CDW}) is attributed to Fermi-surface nesting in textbooks, but this common paradigm is challenged by recent studies that reveal the pronounced effects of electron-phonon interaction and defects. Transition-metal dichalcogenide Ta‚Å¢Te2, being a prototype of charge density wave at around 170 K, is an ideal playground for exploring the mechanism of {CDW}. In this work, we reveal the subtle effect of defects on the {CDW} through studying a series of Ta‚Å¢Te2‚àíùõø (ùõø=0.028‚àí0.123) crystals. Transport measurements show that Ta‚Å¢Te1.972, being close to the stoichiometric compound, have a resistivity-kink feature (fingerprint of {CDW}) around 160 K along both ùëé- and ùëè axes; Ta‚Å¢Te1.933 only has a resistivity-kink feature along the ùëè axis. Remarkably, the resistivity kink completely disappears in Ta‚Å¢Ta1.877. Raman spectroscopy not only confirms the corresponding structural phase transition, but also verifies decreased electron-phonon interaction at the Œì point of the Brillouin zone from Ta‚Å¢Te1.972 to Ta‚Å¢Te1.933 based on analysis of theoretical Fermi surface of 1 ùëá‚Ä≤ phase of Ta‚Å¢Te2 before {CDW} phase transition. We propose that the {CDW} of Ta‚Å¢Te2‚àíùõø (ùõø=0.028‚àí0.067) along the ùëé axis is mainly due to electron-phonon interaction, while {CDW} along the ùëè axis is the synergetic effect of Fermi-surface nesting and electron-phonon interaction; if dopant concentration is high enough (ùõø=0.123), {CDW} is completely quenched by disorder induced by doping. Our study reveals the subtle effects of doping on {CDW}, and may give more hints on the interplay between {CDW} and high-temperature superconductor in the doped Mott insulators.},

	abstract = {Coherent phonons, light-induced coherent lattice vibrations in solids, provide a powerful route to engineer structural and electronic degrees of freedom using light. In this manuscript, we formulate an ab initio theory of the displacive excitation of coherent phonons ({DECP}), the primary mechanism for light-induced structural control in semimetals. Our study - based on the ab initio simulations of the ultrafast electron and coherent-phonon dynamics in presence of electron-phonon interactions - establishes a predictive computational framework for describing the emergence of light-induced structural changes and the ensuing transient band-structure renormalization arising from the {DECP} mechanism. We validate this framework via a combined theoretical and experimental investigation of coherent phonons in the elemental semimetal antimony. Via a Fourier analysis of time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-{ARPES}) measurements, we retrieve information about transient spectral features and quasiparticle renormalization arising from the coherent A1g phonon as a function of momentum, energy, time, and fluence. The qualitative and quantitative agreement between experiment and theory corroborates the first-principles approach formulated in this study. Besides advancing the fundamental understanding of electron-phonon interactions mediated by coherent phonons, this study opens new opportunities for predictively engineering structural and electronic degrees of freedom in semimetals via the {DECP} mechanism.},

Only ùê¥1 modes are detected, although modes with other symmetries are observed with comparable intensity in Raman scattering. We present a theory of the excitation process in this class of materials, which we refer to as displacive excitation of coherent phonons ({DECP}). In {DECP}, after excitation by a pump pulse, the electronically excited system rapidly comes to quasiequilibrium in a time short compared to nuclear response times. In materials with ùê¥1 vibrational modes, the quasiequilibrium nuclear ùê¥1 coordinates are displaced with no change in lattice symmetry, giving rise to a coherent vibration of ùê¥1 symmetry about the displaced quasiequilibrium coordinates. One important prediction of the {DECP} mechanism is the excitation of only modes with ùê¥1 symmetry. Furthermore, the oscillations in the reflectivity R are excited with a cos(œâ0t) dependence, where t=0 is the time of arrival of the pump pulse peak, and œâ0 is the vibrational frequency of the ùê¥1 mode. These predictions agree well with our observations in Bi, Sb, Te, and Ti2O3. The fit of the experimental ŒîR(t)/R(0) data to the theory is excellent.},

The dynamic evolution of the potential energy surface minimum of the coherent phonon coordinate is explored using accurate density functional theory calculations, which confirm a shift of the potential energy surface minimum upon resonant laser excitation and reveal a significant positive contribution to the displacive force due to the cooling of the excited hot electron-hole plasma. We show that this noninstantaneous effect can quantitatively explain the experimentally observed phase using reasonable assumptions for the parameters characterizing the excited carriers.

Applying the technique to the charge density wave material 1T-{TiSe}2, they obtain stroboscopic images of the electronic band structure at high momentum and show that atomic-scale periodic long-scale order collapses on a surprisingly short timescale of 20 femtoseconds.

While most studies have relied on static changes of screening through doping or gating thus far, here we demonstrate that screening can also drive the onset of distinct quantum states on the ultrafast timescale. By using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we show that intense optical excitation can drive 1T-{TiSe}2, a prototypical charge density wave material, almost instantly from a gapped into a semimetallic state. By systematically comparing changes in band structure over time and excitation strength with theoretical calculations, we find that the appearance of this state is likely caused by a dramatic reduction of the screening length. In summary, this work showcases how optical excitation enables the screening-driven design of a nonequilibrium semimetallic phase in {TiSe}2, possibly providing a general pathway into highly screened phases in other strongly correlated materials.},

These changes are crucial in understanding the {CDW} phase, as they provide a measure of the Se4p-Ti3d hybridization strength and characteristic mechanistic features. Using time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ({trARPES}), the unoccupied band structure is populated with near-infrared ({NIR}) pump pulses which allows to directly visualize the parabolically-shaped Ti3d conduction band. Furthermore, we observe a transient change of effective mass in the Se4p valence band following photoexcitation. This occurs alongside an overall reduction due to weakening of the {CDW} phase and is accompanied by an oscillating component with the frequency of the characteristic A1g phonon.

	abstract = {The interaction of many-body systems with intense light pulses may lead to novel emergent phenomena far from equilibrium. Recent discoveries, such as the optical enhancement of the critical temperature in certain superconductors and the photo-stabilization of hidden phases, have turned this field into an important research frontier. Here, we demonstrate nonthermal charge-density-wave ({CDW}) order at electronic temperatures far greater than the thermodynamic transition temperature. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and time-resolved X-ray diffraction, we investigate the electronic and structural order parameters of an ultrafast photoinduced {CDW}-to-metal transition. Tracking the dynamical {CDW} recovery as a function of electronic temperature reveals a behaviour markedly different from equilibrium, which we attribute to the suppression of lattice fluctuations in the transient nonthermal phonon distribution. A complete description of the system‚Äôs coherent and incoherent order-parameter dynamics is given by a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau framework, providing access to the transient potential energy surfaces.},

This demonstrates the existence of more than one collective amplitude mode, in contrast to a simple Peierls model.

At room temperature, it features double zigzag chains of Ta atoms exhibiting metallic bonding. The chains are sandwiched between planes of weakly interacting Te atoms. Below 170 K, the chains appear broken to ‚Äúbutterflylike‚Äù clusters and single zigzag chains of covalently bonded Te atoms emerge while Ta-Te interactions remain largely ionic. This is a rare example of a charge density wave compound stabilized by bonding that is a mix of covalent, ionic, and metallic character giving rise to chemically distinct periodic lattice distortions. We argue that the formation of periodic lattice distortions in the Te sublattice in addition to those in the Ta sublattice favors charge delocalization, which may explain the unusually diminished resistivity and increased magnetic susceptibility exhibited by the low-temperature charge density wave phase of {TaT}‚Å¢e2. The effect may be common for 5‚Å¢ùëë transition metal chalcogenides containing Te because of the extended electronic orbitals of the constituent atoms.},

Discovering pathways to experimentally realize quantum phases of matter and exert control over their properties is a central goal of modern condensed-matter physics, which holds promise for a new generation of electronic/photonic devices with currently inaccessible and likely unimaginable functionalities. In this Review, we describe emerging strategies for selectively perturbing microscopic interaction parameters, which can be used to transform materials into a desired quantum state. Particular emphasis will be placed on recent successes to tailor electronic interaction parameters through the application of intense fields, impulsive electromagnetic stimulation, and nanostructuring or interface engineering.

Transition metal dichalcogenides ({TMDCs}), which are semiconductors of the type {MX}2, where M is a transition metal atom (such as Mo or W) and X is a chalcogen atom (such as S, Se or Te), provide a promising alternative. Because of its robustness, {MoS}2 is the most studied material in this family. {TMDCs} exhibit a unique combination of atomic-scale thickness, direct bandgap, strong spin‚Äìorbit coupling and favourable electronic and mechanical properties, which make them interesting for fundamental studies and for applications in high-end electronics, spintronics, optoelectronics, energy harvesting, flexible electronics, {DNA} sequencing and personalized medicine. In this Review, the methods used to synthesize {TMDCs} are examined and their properties are discussed, with particular attention to their charge density wave, superconductive and topological phases. The use of {TMCDs} in nanoelectronic devices is also explored, along with strategies to improve charge carrier mobility, high frequency operation and the use of strain engineering to tailor their properties.},

	abstract = {The d1 layer metals {TaS} 2 , {TaSe} 2 , {NbSe} 2 , in all their various polytypic modifications, acquire, below some appropriate temperature, phase conditions that their electromagnetic properties have previously revealed as 'anomalous'. Our present electron-microscopic studies indicate that this anomalous behaviour usually included the adoption, at some stage, of a superlattice. The size of superlattice adopted often is forecast in the pattern of satellite spotting and strong diffuse scattering found above the transition. Our conclusions are that charge-density waves and their concomitant periodic structural distortions occur in all these 4d 1 /5d 1 dichalcogenides. We have related the observed periodicities of these {CDW} states to the theoretical form of the parent Fermi surfaces. Particularly for the 1T octahedrally coordinated polytypes the Fermi surface is very simple and markedly two-dimensional in character, with large near-parallel walls. Such a situation is known theoretically to favour the formation of charge and spin-density waves. When they first appear, the {CDWs} in the 1T (and 4Hb) polytypes are incommensurate with the lattice. This condition produes a fair amount of gapping in the density of states at the Fermi level. For the simplest case of 1T-{TaSe} 2 , the room temperature superlattice is realized when this existing {CDW} rotates into an orientation for which it then become commensurate. At this first-order transition the Fermi surface energy gapping increases beyond that generated by the incommensurate {CDW}, as is clearly evident in the electromagnetic properties. For the trigonal prismatically coordinated polytypes, {CDW} formation is withheld to low temperatures, probably because of the more complex band structures. This {CDW} state (in the cases measured) would seem at once commensurate, even though the transition is, from a wide variety of experiments, apparently second order. A wide range of doped and intercalated materials have been used to substantiate the presence of {CDWs} in these compounds, and to clarify the effect that their occurrence has on the physical properties. The observations further demonstrate the distinctiveness of the transition metal dichalcogenide layer compounds, and of the group {VA} metals in particular.},

The phenomena to be touched on will include optical and transport properties including fast ion conduction, superconductivity, staging, magnetic properties and metal insulator transitions. Similarities to the high temperature superconductors will also be suggested.

Solids such as {TaS}2 undergo a ‚ÄúPeierls‚Äù distortion, and intercalation sets up random potentials to bring about a reduction in the density of states at the Fermi level, and this results in electron localisation and variable range hopping. Similar effects can in fact also be seen in ‚Äúone-dimensional‚Äù systems such as polyacetylene. Possible practical applications will be discussed, including high energy density batteries, and in particular the role of the amorphous polymer phase in the solid electrolyte, polyethylene oxide-lithium triflate, will be mentioned.},

	abstract = {The one-dimensional case of free electrons interacting with lattice displacements is solved by a self-consistent method. It is found that for a certain range of the interaction parametera single sinusoidal lattice displacement is strongly excited in the lowest level of the system. Its wave-length is such as to create an energy gap in the single-electron energy spectrum with all states below it filled, and all above it empty. This periodic lattice displacement plays the role of an ‚Äòinner field‚Äô and leads to periodic fluctuation in the electronic density in such a way that the two stabilize each other. In an infinite medium described by a periodic boundary condition they are not fixed absolutely in space, but only relative to each other. Excitation of electrons across the gap leads to a decrease in both the electronic density fluctuations and the width of the gap. The whole system, electrons plus lattice displacements, can move through the lattice without being disturbed provided the velocity v is sufficiently small. The inertia of this system is equal to that of all electrons augmented by a term due to the lattice displacements. Elastic scattering of individual electrons which normally leads to the residual resistance is impossible if v is sufficiently small. The linear specific heat of normal electrons is eliminated and replaced by an exponential term.},

A uniform {IF} phase with a relatively narrow size distribution was obtained. The synthesis of {IFs} appears to require, in addition to careful control over the growth conditions, a specific turbulent flow regime. The x-ray spectra of the different samples show that, as the average size of the {IF} decreases, the van der Waals gap along the c axis increases, largely because of the strain involved in folding of the lamella. Large quantities of quite uniform nanotubes were obtained under modified preparation conditions.},

Here we report the formation of equivalent stable structures in the layered semiconductor tungsten disulphide. After the heating of thin tungsten films in an atmosphere of hydrogen sulphide, transmission electron microscopy reveals a variety of concentric polyhedral and cylindrical structures (ranging in size from {\textless}10 to {\textgreater}100 nm) growing from the amorphous tungsten matrix. The closed nature of the structures is verified by electron diffraction and lattice imaging. As with the carbon system, complete closure of the tungsten disulphide layers requires the presence of structural defects (for example, edge dislocations), or the arrangement of atoms in polyhedra other than a planar hexagonal geometry.},

Here I report the preparation of a new type of finite carbon structure consisting of needle-like tubes. Produced using an arc-discharge evaporation method similar to that used for fullerene synthesis, the needles grow at the negative end of the electrode used for the arc discharge. Electron microscopy reveals that each needle comprises coaxial tubes of graphitic sheets, ranging in number from 2 up to about 50. On each tube the  carbon-atom hexagons are arranged in a helical fashion about the needle axis. The helical pitch varies from needle to needle and from tube to tube  within a single needle. It appears that this helical structure may aid the growth process. The formation of these needles, ranging from a few to a few tens of nanometres in diameter, suggests that engineering of carbon structures should be possible on scales considerably greater than those relevant to the fullerenes.},

	abstract = {Very thin crystals of molybdenum disulphide, less than 100 √Ö thick, have been prepared by cleavage. The optical absorption spectra in the thickness range several micrometres to less than 100 √Ö are similar. Absorption coefficients have been measured to values close to 106 cm-1. The absorption bands observed with thin crystals are associated with bulk rather than surface properties. Deviations from an exponential relation between transmission and thickness are observed as the crystal thickness is decreased. The transmission begins to oscillate and thick crystals may transm it more light than thinner ones. Three absorption edges have been observed in the absorption spectrum at about 7000, 5000 and 3000 √Ö, and structure is observed on the first edge at 4 ¬∞K. It is suggested that the levels at the top of the valence band are split by spin-orbit interaction. The edges at 5000 and 3000 √Ö may be due to transitions at other values of the wave vector or from deeper valence bands. The absorption peaks correspond to exciton lines close to the conduction band. Photoconductivity has been observed at 77 ¬∞K. A response at both absorption edges is detected, and photoconduction peaks are observed at the wavelengths of the exciton bands. Values for the refractive index have been obtained in the region of the first absorption edge, and out to 2 Œºm. Comparison of the optical and low-frequency dielectric constants indicate that the bonding is covalent. The absorption edges and the exciton bands of single crystals and polycrystalline films are compared. The impurity content of the natural crystals has no effect on the properties observed.},

Manipulation of the interlayer excitons in {TMD} {vdW} heterostructures holds great promise for the development of excitonic integrated circuits that serve as the counterpart of electronic integrated circuits, which allows the photons and excitons to transform into each other and thus bridges optical communication and signal processing at the integrated circuit. As a consequence, numerous studies have been carried out to obtain deep insight into the physical properties of interlayer excitons, including revealing their ultrafast formation, long population recombination lifetimes, and intriguing spin-valley dynamics. These outstanding properties ensure interlayer excitons with good transport characteristics, and may pave the way for their potential applications in efficient excitonic devices based on {TMD} {vdW} heterostructures. At present, a systematic and comprehensive overview of interlayer exciton formation, relaxation, transport, and potential applications is still lacking. In this review, we give a comprehensive description and discussion of these frontier topics for interlayer excitons in {TMD} {vdW} heterostructures to provide valuable guidance for researchers in this field.},

Such moir√©-induced emergent phenomena are particularly strong for interlayer excitons, where the hole and the electron are localized in different layers of the heterostructure19,20. To exploit the full potential of correlated moir√© and exciton physics, a thorough understanding of the ultrafast interlayer exciton formation process and the real-space wavefunction confinement is indispensable. Here we show that femtosecond photoemission momentum microscopy provides quantitative access to these key properties of the moir√© interlayer excitons. First, we elucidate that interlayer excitons are dominantly formed through femtosecond exciton‚Äìphonon scattering and subsequent charge transfer¬†at the interlayer-hybridized Œ£ valleys. Second, we show that interlayer excitons exhibit a momentum fingerprint that is a direct hallmark of the superlattice moir√© modification. Third, we reconstruct the wavefunction distribution of the electronic part of the exciton and compare the size with the real-space moir√© superlattice. Our work provides direct access to interlayer exciton formation dynamics in space and time and reveals opportunities to study correlated moir√© and exciton physics for the future realization of exotic quantum phases of matter.},

Transition metal dichalcogenides ({TMDCs}), which are semiconductors of the type {MX}2, where M is a transition metal atom (such as Mo or W) and X is a chalcogen atom (such as S, Se or Te), provide a promising alternative. Because of its robustness, {MoS}2 is the most studied material in this family. {TMDCs} exhibit a unique combination of atomic-scale thickness, direct bandgap, strong spin‚Äìorbit coupling and favourable electronic and mechanical properties, which make them interesting for fundamental studies and for applications in high-end electronics, spintronics, optoelectronics, energy harvesting, flexible electronics, {DNA} sequencing and personalized medicine. In this Review, the methods used to synthesize {TMDCs} are examined and their properties are discussed, with particular attention to their charge density wave, superconductive and topological phases. The use of {TMCDs} in nanoelectronic devices is also explored, along with strategies to improve charge carrier mobility, high frequency operation and the use of strain engineering to tailor their properties.},

Below 170 K, the chains appear broken to ‚Äúbutterflylike‚Äù clusters and single zigzag chains of covalently bonded Te atoms emerge while Ta-Te interactions remain largely ionic. This is a rare example of a charge density wave compound stabilized by bonding that is a mix of covalent, ionic, and metallic character giving rise to chemically distinct periodic lattice distortions. We argue that the formation of periodic lattice distortions in the Te sublattice in addition to those in the Ta sublattice favors charge delocalization, which may explain the unusually diminished resistivity and increased magnetic susceptibility exhibited by the low-temperature charge density wave phase of {TaT}‚Å¢e2.

	abstract = {All conventional metals are known to possess a three-dimensional Fermi surface, which is the locus in reciprocal space of the long-lived electronic excitations that govern their electronic properties at low temperatures. These excitations should have well-defined momenta with components in all three dimensions. The high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) copper oxide superconductors have unusual, highly two-dimensional properties above the superconducting transition1. This, coupled with a lack of unambiguous evidence for a three-dimensional Fermi surface, has led to many new and exotic models for the underlying electronic ground state2. Here we report the observation of polar angular magnetoresistance oscillations3 in the overdoped superconductor Tl2Ba2CuO6+Œ¥ in high magnetic fields, which firmly establishes the existence of a coherent three-dimensional Fermi surface. Analysis of the oscillations reveals that at certain symmetry points, however, this surface is strictly two-dimensional. This striking form of the Fermi surface topography, long-predicted by electronic band structure calculations4, provides a natural explanation for a wide range of anisotropic properties both in the normal5,6 and superconducting states7,8,9. Our data reveal that, despite their extreme electrical anisotropy, the high-Tc materials at high doping levels can be understood within a framework of conventional three-dimensional metal physics.},

	abstract = {The phase diagram of the cuprate superconductors continues to pose formidable scientific challenges. While these materials are typically viewed as doped Mott insulators, it is well known that they are Fermi liquids at high hole-dopant concentrations. It was recently demonstrated that at moderate doping, in the pseudogap ({PG}) region of the phase diagram, the charge carriers are also best described as a Fermi liquid. Nevertheless, the relationship between the two Fermi-liquid ({FL}) regions and the nature of the strange-metal ({SM}) state at intermediate doping have remained unsolved. Here we show for the case of the model cuprate superconductor {HgBa}2CuO4+Œ¥ that the normal-state transport scattering rate determined from the cotangent of the Hall angle remains quadratic in temperature across the {PG} temperature, upon entering the {SM} state, and that it is doping-independent below optimal doping. Analysis of prior transport results for other cuprates reveals that this behavior is universal throughout the entire phase diagram and points to a pervasive {FL} transport scattering rate. These observations can be reconciled with a variety of other experimental results for the cuprates upon considering the possibility that the {PG} phenomenon is associated with the gradual, non-uniform localization of one hole per planar {CuO}2 unit.},

Here we show that the resistivity of the cuprate strange metals Nd0.4La1.6‚àí{xSrxCuO}4 (ref. 7) and La2‚àí{xSrxCuO}4 (ref. 8) is quantitatively consistent with the standard Boltzmann theory of electron motion in a magnetic field, in all aspects‚Äîfield strength, field direction, temperature and disorder level. The linear field dependence is found to be simply the consequence of scattering rate anisotropy. We conclude that Planckian dissipation is anomalous in its temperature dependence, but not in its field dependence. The scattering rate in these cuprates does not depend on field, which means that their Planckian dissipation is robust against fields up to at least 85‚ÄâT.},

We also discuss the relevance of the often-neglected direct oxygen-oxygenhopping for a more accurate, sometimes unique, description of this class of materials. Thebenchmark of the solution is performed by comparing our results with the available {quantumMonte} Carlo ones. Both single-particle and thermodynamic properties of the model arestudied in detail. Our solution features a metal-insulator transition at half filling. Theresulting metal-insulator phase diagram agrees qualitatively very well with the oneobtained within dynamical mean-field theory. We discuss the type of transition(Mott-Hubbard ({MH}) or charge-transfer ({CT})) for the microscopic (ab¬†initio) parameterrange relevant for cuprates getting, as expected a {CT} type. The emerging single-particlescenario clearly suggests a very close relation between the relevant sub-bands of thethree- (Emery) and the single-band (Hubbard) models, thus providing an independent andnon-perturbative proof of the validity of the mapping between the two models for the modelparameters optimal to describe cuprates. Such a result confirms the emergence of {theZhang}-Rice scenario, which has been recently questioned. We also report the behavior ofthe specific heat and of the entropy as functions of the temperature on varying the modelparameters as these quantities, more than any other, depend on and, consequently, revealthe most relevant energy scales of the system.},

	abstract = {The last decade witnessed significant progress in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ({ARPES}) and its applications. Today, {ARPES} experiments with 2-{meV} energy resolution and 0.2¬∞ angular resolution are a reality even for photoemission on solids. These technological advances and the improved sample quality have enabled {ARPES} to emerge as a leading tool in the investigation of the high-ùëáùëê superconductors. This paper reviews the most recent {ARPES} results on the cuprate superconductors and their insulating parent and sister compounds, with the purpose of providing an updated summary of the extensive literature. The low-energy excitations are discussed with emphasis on some of the most relevant issues, such as the Fermi surface and remnant Fermi surface, the superconducting gap, the pseudogap and ùëë-wave-like dispersion, evidence of electronic inhomogeneity and nanoscale phase separation, the emergence of coherent quasiparticles through the superconducting transition, and many-body effects in the one-particle spectral function due to the interaction of the charge with magnetic and/or lattice degrees of freedom. Given the dynamic nature of the field, we chose to focus mainly on reviewing the experimental data, as on the experimental side a general consensus has been reached, whereas interpretations and related theoretical models can vary significantly. The first part of the paper introduces photoemission spectroscopy in the context of strongly interacting systems, along with an update on the state-of-the-art instrumentation. The second part provides an overview of the scientific issues relevant to the investigation of the low-energy electronic structure by {ARPES}. The rest of the paper is devoted to the experimental results from the cuprates, and the discussion is organized along conceptual lines: normal-state electronic structure, interlayer interaction, superconducting gap, coherent superconducting peak, pseudogap, electron self-energy, and collective modes. Within each topic, {ARPES} data from the various copper oxides are presented.},

Such studies of the interaction between the ultrafast laser and the quantum materials are the frontiers and attract significant research interests in the field of condensed matter physics. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is a key experimental tool to study the ultrafast electronic dynamics in quantum materials after photoexcitation. This paper reviews the development of a high-resolution time- and angle-resolved photoemission system based on nonlinear optical crystals and the studies on the ultrafast electronic dynamics in quantum materials using such a setup, including (1) probing the unoccupied electronic states in quantum materials, (2) photoinduced ultrafast electronic phase transitions, and (3) photoinduced new states of matter.},

	abstract = {Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ({ARPES}), with its exceptional sensitivity to both the binding energy and the momentum of valence electrons in solids, provides unparalleled insight into the electronic structure of quantum materials. Over the past two decades, the advent of femtosecond lasers, which can deliver ultrashort and coherent light pulses, has ushered the {ARPES} technique into the time domain. Currently time-resolved {ARPES} ({TR}-{ARPES}) can probe ultrafast electron dynamics and the out-of-equilibrium electronic structure, providing a wealth of information that is otherwise unattainable in conventional {ARPES} experiments. This review begins with an introduction to the theoretical underpinnings of {TR}-{ARPES} followed by a description of recent advances in state-of-the-art ultrafast sources and optical excitation schemes. It then reviews paradigmatic phenomena investigated by {TR}-{ARPES} thus far, such as out-of-equilibrium electronic states and their spin dynamics, Floquet-Volkov states, photoinduced phase transitions, electron-phonon coupling, and surface photovoltage effects. Each section highlights {TR}-{ARPES} data from diverse classes of quantum materials, including semiconductors, charge-ordered systems, topological materials, excitonic insulators, Van der Waals materials, and unconventional superconductors. These examples demonstrate how {TR}-{ARPES} has played a critical role in unraveling the complex dynamical properties of quantum materials. The conclusion outlines possible future directions and opportunities.},

Unlike the linear-response regime, where the frequency-dependent response function is independent of time, in a far-from-equilibrium experiment, the response function depends on two times in the time domain. In this work, we describe how one can use time-dependent frequency response functions and how they involve contributions from times that are near to each other. This implies that they should not be thought of as a frequency-dependent response at a single definite time. Instead, the Fourier uncertainty relations show that they involve contributions from ranges of times and must be interpreted in this light. We use this insight to help understand what time-resolved photoemission measurements actually measure.},

	abstract = {Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ({ARPES}) is the most powerful technique to investigate the electronic band structure of crystalline solids. To completely characterize the electronic structure of topological materials, one needs to go beyond band structure mapping and access information about the momentum-resolved Bloch wave function, namely, orbitals, Berry curvature, and topological invariants. However, because phase information is lost in the process of measuring photoemission intensities, retrieving the complex-valued Bloch wave function from photoemission data has yet remained elusive. We introduce a novel measurement methodology and associated observable in extreme ultraviolet angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, based on continuous modulation of the ionizing radiation polarization axis. Tracking the energy- and momentum-resolved amplitude and phase of the photoemission intensity modulation upon polarization axis rotation allows us to retrieve the circular dichroism in photoelectron angular distributions ({CDAD}) without using circular photons, providing direct insights into the phase of photoemission matrix elements. In the case of two relevant bands, it is possible to reconstruct the orbital pseudospin (and thus the Bloch wave function) with moderate theory input, as demonstrated for the prototypical, layered, semiconducting, transition metal dichalcogenide . This novel measurement methodology in {ARPES}, which is articulated around the manipulation of the photoionization transition dipole matrix element, in combination with a simple tight-binding theory, is general and adds a new dimension to obtaining insights into the orbital pseudospin, Berry curvature, and Bloch wave functions of many relevant crystalline solids.},

Owing to the inherent strong spin‚Äìorbit coupling, the conventional hand-waving picture of the Dirac surface state with a single chiral spin texture is incomplete, as this ignores the orbital components of the Dirac wavefunction and their coupling to the spin textures. Here, by combining orbital-selective angle-resolved photoemission experiments and first-principles calculations, we deconvolve the in-plane and out-of-plane p-orbital components of the Dirac wavefunction. The in-plane orbital wavefunction is asymmetric relative to the Dirac point. It is predominantly tangential (radial) to the k-space constant energy surfaces above (below) the Dirac point. This orbital texture switch occurs exactly at the Dirac point, and therefore should be intrinsic to the topological physics. Our results imply that the Dirac wavefunction has a spin‚Äìorbital texture‚Äîa superposition of orbital wavefunctions coupled with the corresponding spin textures.},

However, the momentum- and energy-resolved transient photoemission intensity may not be unambiguously described by the intrinsic relaxation dynamics of photoexcited electrons alone. The interpretation of the time-dependent photoemission signal can be affected by the transient evolution of the electronic distribution, and both the one-electron removal spectral function as well as the photoemission matrix elements. Here we investigate the topological insulator Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S to demonstrate, by means of a detailed probe-polarization dependent study, the transient contribution of matrix elements to {TR}-{ARPES}.},

The pump-induced dynamics can be described in different gauges for the light‚Äìmatter interaction. Standard minimal coupling leads to the velocity gauge, defined by linear coupling to the vector potential. In the context of tight-binding ({TB}) models, the Peierls substitution is the commonly employed scheme for single-band models. Multi-orbital extensions ‚Äì including the coupling of the dipole moments to the electric field ‚Äì have been introduced and tested recently. In this work, we derive the theory of time-resolved photoemission within both gauges from the perspective of nonequilibrium Green‚Äôs functions. This approach naturally incorporates the photoelectron continuum, which allows for a direct calculation of the observable photocurrent. Following this route we introduce gauge-invariant expressions for the time-resolved photoemission signal. The theory is applied to graphene pumped with short terahertz pulses, which we treat within a first-principles {TB} model. We investigate the gauge invariance and discuss typical effects observed in subcycle time-resolved photoemission. Our formalism is an ideal starting point for realistic {trARPES} simulations including scattering effects.},

	abstract = {In recent years, strong-field physics in condensed matter was pioneered as a potential approach for controlling material properties through laser dressing, as well as for ultrafast spectroscopy via nonlinear light-matter interactions (e.g., harmonic generation). A potential controversy arising from these advancements is that it is sometimes vague which band picture should be used to interpret strong-field experiments: The field-free bands, the adiabatic (instantaneous) field-dressed bands, Floquet bands, or some other intermediate picture. Here, we try to resolve this issue by performing theoretical experiments of time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (Tr-{ARPES}) for a strong-field laser-pumped solid, which should give access to the actual observable bands of the irradiated material. To our surprise, we find that the adiabatic band picture survives quite well up to high field intensities (‚àº1012‚Å¢W/c‚Å¢m2) and in a wide frequency range (driving wavelengths of 4000 to 800 nm, with Keldysh parameters ranging up to ‚àº7). We conclude that, to first order, the adiabatic instantaneous bands should be the standard blueprint for interpreting ultrafast electron dynamics in solids when the field is highly off resonant with characteristic energy scales of the material. We then discuss weaker effects of modifications of the bands beyond this picture that are nonadiabatic, showing that by using bichromatic fields the deviations from the standard picture can be probed with enhanced sensitivity. In this paper, we outline a clear band picture for the physics of strong-field interactions in solids, which should be useful for designing and analyzing strong-field experimental observables and to formulate simpler semi-empirical models.},

Unlike the linear-response regime, where the frequency-dependent response function is independent of time, in a far-from-equilibrium experiment, the response function depends on two times in the time domain. In this work, we describe how one can use time-dependent frequency response functions and how they involve contributions from times that are near to each other. This implies that they should not be thought of as a frequency-dependent response at a single definite time. Instead, the Fourier uncertainty relations show that they involve contributions from ranges of times and must be interpreted in this light. We use this insight to help understand what time-resolved photoemission measurements actually measure.},

	abstract = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, ‚Ñè‚Å¢ùúî. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average (‚Ñè‚Å¢ùúî)2, consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about at K to zero at . Tables of matrix elements of single-particle operators between the excited-state superconducting wave functions, useful for perturbation expansions and calculations of transition probabilities, are given.},

Finally an abrupt decrease by up to three orders of magnitude occurs, reminiscent of the onset of percolative superconductivity. The highest onset temperature is observed in the 30 K range.

Evidence is presented here to show that about half of the ùëë orbitals (2.56 of the total of 5) are involved in bond formation, through hybridization with the 4‚Å¢ùë† and 4‚Å¢ùëù orbitals, and that the number of covalent bonds resonating among the available interatomic positions increases from one to nearly six in the sequence K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, remains nearly constant from Cr to Ni, and begins to decrease with Cu. The remaining 2.44 ùëë orbitals, with very small interatomic overlapping, are occupied by nonbonding electrons which are mainly responsible for the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic properties of the metals. This point of view provides a qualitative explanation of many properties of the transition metals (including those of the palladium and platinum groups), such as interatomic distance, characteristic, temperature, hardness, compressibility, and coefficient of thermal expansion, and it accounts satisfactorily for the observed values of the atomic saturation magnetic moments of the ferromagnetic elements iron, cobalt, and nickel and their alloys.

	abstract = {In conventional superconductors, lattice vibrations (phonons) mediate the attraction between electrons that is responsible for superconductivity1. The high transition temperatures (high-Tc) of the copper oxide superconductors has led to collective spin excitations being proposed as the mediating excitations in these materials2. The mediating excitations must be strongly coupled to the conduction electrons, have energy greater than the pairing energy, and be present at Tc. The most obvious feature in the magnetic excitations of high-Tc superconductors such as {YBa}2Cu3O6+x is the so-called ‚Äòresonance‚Äô3,4,5,6. Although the resonance may be strongly coupled to the superconductivity3,4,5,6,7,8, it is unlikely to be the main cause, because it has not been found in the La2-x(Ba,Sr){xCuO}4 family and is not universally present in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+Œ¥ (ref. 9). Here we use inelastic neutron scattering to characterize possible mediating excitations at higher energies in {YBa}2Cu3O6.6. We observe a square-shaped continuum of excitations peaked at incommensurate positions. These excitations have energies greater than the superconducting pairing energy, are present at Tc, and have spectral weight far exceeding that of the ‚Äòresonance‚Äô. The discovery of similar excitations in La2‚Äì{xBaxCuO}4 (ref. 10) suggests that they are a general property of the copper oxides, and a candidate for mediating the electron pairing.},

	abstract = {We review recent experimental and theoretical results on the interaction between single-particle excitations and collective spin excitations in the superconducting state of high-Tc cuprates. We concentrate on the traces that sharpen features in the magnetic-excitation spectrum (measured by inelastic neutron scattering) and imprint in the spectra of single-particle excitations (measured, e.g. by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, tunnelling spectroscopy, and indirectly also by optical spectroscopy). The ideal object to obtain a quantitative picture for these interaction effects is a spin-1 excitation around 40 {meV}, termed ‚Äòresonance mode‚Äô. Although the total weight of this spin-1 excitation is small, the confinement of its weight to a rather narrow momentum region around the antiferromagnetic wavevector makes it possible to observe strong self-energy effects in parts of the electronic Brillouin zone. Notably, the sharpness of the magnetic excitation in energy has allowed these self-energy effects to be traced in the single-particle spectrum rather precisely. Namely, the doping and temperature dependence together with the characteristic energy and momentum behaviour of the resonance mode has been used as a tool to examine the corresponding self-energy effects in the dispersion and in the spectral line-shape of the single-particle spectra, and to separate them from similar effects due to the electron‚Äìphonon interaction. This leads to the unique possibility to single out the self-energy effects due to the spin‚Äìfermion interaction and to directly determine the strength of this interaction in high-Tc cuprate superconductors. The knowledge of this interaction is important for the interpretation of other experimental results as well as for the quest for the still unknown pairing mechanism in these interesting superconducting materials.},

	abstract = {The elementary {CuO}2 plane sustaining cuprate high-temperature superconductivity occurs typically at the base of a periodic array of edge-sharing {CuO}5 pyramids. Virtual transitions of electrons between adjacent planar Cu and O atoms, occurring at a rate t/‚Ñè and across the charge-transfer energy gap 
E

J‚âà4t4/E3
 in an antiferromagnetic correlated-insulator state. However, hole doping this {CuO}2 plane converts this into a very-high-temperature superconducting state whose electron pairing is exceptional. A leading proposal for the mechanism of this intense electron pairing is that, while hole doping destroys magnetic order, it preserves pair-forming superexchange interactions governed by the charge-transfer energy scale 
E
. To explore this hypothesis directly at atomic scale, we combine single-electron and electron-pair (Josephson) scanning tunneling microscopy to visualize the interplay of 
E
 and the electron-pair density {nP} in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x. The responses of both 
E
 and {nP} to alterations in the distance Œ¥ between planar Cu and apical O atoms are then determined. These data reveal the empirical crux of strongly correlated superconductivity in {CuO}2, the response of the electron-pair condensate to varying the charge-transfer energy. Concurrence of predictions from strong-correlation theory for hole-doped charge-transfer insulators with these observations indicates that charge-transfer superexchange is the electron-pairing mechanism of superconductive Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x.},

(Beijing) 61, 1826‚Äì1832 (2016)], a quantity accessible in the normal state, is detrimental to superconductivity. We solve the three-band Hubbard model with cellular dynamical mean-field theory and show that both of these observations follow from the model. Cuprates play a special role among doped charge-transfer insulators of transition metal oxides because copper has the largest covalent bonding with oxygen. Experiments [L. Wang et al., {arXiv} [Preprint] (2020). https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05029 (Accessed 10 November 2020)] also suggest that superexchange is at the origin of superconductivity in cuprates. Our results reveal the consistency of these experiments with the above two experimental findings. Indeed, we show that covalency and a charge-transfer gap lead to an effective short-range superexchange interaction between copper spins that ultimately explains pairing and superconductivity in the three-band Hubbard model of cuprates.},

In high-temperature cuprate¬†superconductors, coherent driving of certain phonon modes has resulted in a transient state with superconducting-like optical properties, observed far above their transition temperature¬†Tc and throughout the pseudogap phase15‚Äì18. However, questions remain on the microscopic nature of this transient state and how to distinguish it from a non-superconducting state with enhanced carrier mobility. For example, it is not known whether cuprates driven in this fashion exhibit Meissner diamagnetism. Here we examine the time-dependent magnetic field surrounding an optically driven {YBa}2Cu3O6.48 crystal by measuring Faraday rotation in a magneto-optic material placed in the vicinity of the sample. For a constant applied magnetic field and under the same driving conditions that result in superconducting-like optical properties15‚Äì18, a transient diamagnetic response was observed. This response is comparable in size with that expected in an equilibrium type {II} superconductor of similar shape and size with a volume susceptibility œáv of order ‚àí0.3. This value is incompatible with a photo-induced increase in mobility without superconductivity. Rather, it underscores the notion of a pseudogap phase in which incipient superconducting correlations are enhanced or synchronized by the drive.},

This result is consistent with our analysis of the ratio of changes in the hole content at the ùëë and ùëù orbitals due to doping, which, according to an experimental study, increases with the increasing maximal critical temperature [cf.

	abstract = {In conventional superconductors, the phase transition into a zero-resistance and perfectly diamagnetic state is accompanied by a jump in the specific heat and the opening of a spectral gap1. In the high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprates, although the transport, magnetic and thermodynamic signatures of Tc have been known since the 1980s2, the spectroscopic singularity associated with the transition remains unknown. Here we resolve this long-standing puzzle with a high-precision angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ({ARPES}) study on overdoped (Bi,Pb)2Sr2CaCu2O8+Œ¥ (Bi2212). We first probe the momentum-resolved electronic specific heat via spectroscopy and reproduce the specific heat peak at Tc, completing the missing link for a holistic description of superconductivity. Then, by studying the full momentum, energy and temperature evolution of the spectra, we reveal that this thermodynamic anomaly arises from the singular growth of in-gap spectral intensity across Tc. Furthermore, we observe that the temperature evolution of in-gap intensity is highly anisotropic in the momentum space, and the gap itself obeys both the d-wave functional form and particle‚Äìhole symmetry. These findings support the scenario that the superconducting transition is driven by phase fluctuations. They also serve as an anchor point for understanding the Fermi arc and pseudogap phenomena in underdoped cuprates.},

For clean vacuum junctions formed between a cleaved {BSCCO} single crystal and the normal-metal tip of a scanning tunneling microscope, we obtain stable c-axis vacuum tunneling conditions that allow very reproducible low-temperature electron tunneling spectroscopy. A vacuum junction is identified by tunneling spectra which neither depend on tip/sample spacing nor change as a function of time and position on the sample in the Meissner state. In contrast to the frequently reported linear or parabolic increase with increasing bias voltage, the background conductance of such spectra is largely constant with a slight decrease up to ¬±300 {meV} bias. The normal-state conductance inferred from this background has a local maximum at negative sample bias, indicating a pileup below the Fermi level in the (ab)-plane normal-state density of states of {BSCCO}. Vacuum junctions at 4.8 K show a well developed superconducting gap with large peaks at the gap edges and a finite density of quasiparticle excitations filling the gap. These characteristics are not consistent with an isotropic {BCS}-like gap parameter. Outside the superconducting gap, the differential conductance curves are very asymmetric, with a striking dip which appears at negative sample bias only. This dip contributes a substantial amount of states to satisfy the conservation of states we find between normal and superconducting {BSCCO}.},

	abstract = {The parent compounds of the copper oxide high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors are unusual insulators (so-called Mott insulators). Superconductivity arises when they are ‚Äòdoped‚Äô away from stoichiometry1. For the compound Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x, doping is achieved by adding extra oxygen atoms, which introduce positive charge carriers (‚Äòholes‚Äô) into the {CuO}2 planes where the superconductivity is believed to originate. Aside from providing the charge carriers, the role of the oxygen dopants is not well understood, nor is it clear how the charge carriers are distributed on the planes. Many models of high-Tc superconductivity accordingly assume that the introduced carriers are distributed uniformly, leading to an electronically homogeneous system as in ordinary metals. Here we report the presence of an electronic inhomogeneity in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x, on the basis of observations using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy. The inhomogeneity is manifested as spatial variations in both the local density of states spectrum and the superconducting energy gap. These variations are correlated spatially and vary on the surprisingly short length scale of ‚àº14‚Äâ√Ö. Our analysis suggests that this inhomogeneity is a consequence of proximity to a Mott insulator resulting in poor screening of the charge potentials associated with the oxygen ions left in the {BiO} plane after doping, and is indicative of the local nature of the superconducting state.},

The pairing interaction between the two electrons of a Cooper pair determines the gap function. Thus, it is pivotal to detect the gap structure for understanding the mechanism of superconductivity. In cuprate superconductors, it has been well established that the gap may have a d-wave function. This gap function has an alternative sign change in the momentum space. It is however hard to visualize this sign change. Here we report the measurements of scanning tunneling spectroscopy in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+Œ¥ and conduct the analysis of phase-referenced quasiparticle interference ({QPI}). We see the seven basic scattering vectors that connect the octet ends of the banana-shaped contour of Fermi surface. The phase-referenced {QPI} clearly visualizes the sign change of the d-wave gap. Our results illustrate an effective way for determining the sign change of unconventional superconductors.},

The development of alternative theories incorporating strong electron correlations is currently at the forefront of research in condensed-matter physics. In this context, inelastic neutron scattering can provide valuable insight into collective magnetic excitations in the copper oxide superconductors and so guide these theoretical efforts. Such measurements require large single crystals, and have hitherto been restricted to just two families of high-temperature superconductors‚ÄîLa2‚àí{xSrxCuO}4 (ref. 1) and {YBa}2Cu3O6+x (ref. 2). Although the magnetic spectra of these two materials bear certain similarities, there are also important differences. In particular, a sharpresonant spin excitation dominates the spectrum in the superconducting state of {YBa}2Cu3O6+x (3‚Äì10), but is not observed in La2‚àí{xSrxCuO}4 (ref. 1). Here we report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of a different copper oxide system‚ÄîBi2Sr2CaCu2O8+Œ¥‚Äîin which we observe a magnetic resonance peak in the superconducting state.

Clear evidence for quantum criticality, particularly in the transport properties, has proved elusive because the important low-temperature region is masked by the onset of superconductivity. We present measurements of the low-temperature in-plane resistivity of several highly doped La2‚Äì{xSrxCuO}4 single crystals in which the superconductivity had been stripped away by using high magnetic fields. In contrast to other quantum critical systems, the resistivity varies linearly with temperature over a wide doping range with a gradient that scales monotonically with the superconducting transition temperature. It is maximal at a critical doping level (pc) ‚àº 0.19 at which superconductivity is most robust. Moreover, its value at pc corresponds to the onset of quasi-particle incoherence along specific momentum directions, implying that the interaction that first promotes high-temperature superconductivity may ultimately destroy the very quasi-particle states involved in the superconducting pairing.},

	abstract = {Quantum criticality is associated with a system composed of a nearly infinite number of interacting quantum degrees of freedom at zero temperature, and it implies that the system looks on average the same regardless of the time- and length scale on which it is observed. Electrons on the atomic scale do not exhibit such symmetry, which can only be generated as a collective phenomenon through the interactions between a large number of electrons. In materials with strong electron correlations a quantum phase transition at zero temperature can occur, and a quantum critical state has been predicted1,2, which manifests itself through universal power-law behaviours of the response functions. Candidates have been found both in heavy-fermion systems3 and in the high-transition temperature (high-Tc) copper oxide superconductors4, but the reality and the physical nature of such a phase transition are still debated5,6,7. Here we report a universal behaviour that is characteristic of the quantum critical region. We demonstrate that the experimentally measured phase angle agrees precisely with the exponent of the optical conductivity. This points towards a quantum phase transition of an unconventional kind in the high-Tc superconductors.},

Here we show that T-linear resistivity as T‚Äâ‚Üí‚Äâ0 is a generic property of cuprates, associated with a universal scattering rate. We measured the low-temperature resistivity of the bilayer cuprate Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+Œ¥ and found that it exhibits a T-linear dependence with the same slope as in the single-layer cuprates Bi2Sr2CuO6+Œ¥ (ref.‚Äâ6), La1.6‚àí{xNd}0.4SrxCuO4 (ref.‚Äâ7) and La2‚àí{xSrxCuO}4 (ref.‚Äâ8), despite their very different Fermi surfaces and structural, superconducting and magnetic properties.

Using the precise existing data for the Fermi surface topography and quasiparticle velocities of Sr3Ru2O7, we show that in the region of the T-linear resistivity, the scattering rate per kelvin is well approximated by the ratio of the Boltzmann constant to the Planck constant divided by 2œÄ. Extending the analysis to a number of other materials reveals similar results in the T-linear region, in spite of large differences in the microscopic origins of the scattering.},

Superexchange itself is shown to be closely related to the poor conductivity, in agreement with experiment. By means of crystal field theory the parameters determining superexchange can be estimated, and in favorable cases ({NiO}, {LaFeO}3) the exchange integrals can be evaluated with accuracy of several tens of percent. Qualitative understanding of the whole picture of exchange in iron group oxides and fluorides follows from these ideas.},

	abstract = {A theoretical review is given on high temperature superconductivity in copper oxides (cuprates) by focusing on the hole doping cases based on the view that it is realized in carrier doped Mott insulators, as noted by Anderson in the initial stage. From the detailed knowledge of electronic states deduced from experiments that showed the undoped parent case is Mott insulators (charge transfer type insulators, to be precise) and that the hole doping is mainly on oxygen sites, the t‚ÄìJ model, as derived by Zhang and Rice, is shown to be a canonical model for hole doped cuprates and values of various parameters of the model have been assessed. Results of many different numerical methods so far obtained for this t‚ÄìJ model, especially the variational Monte Carlo method, have clearly indicated the stability of the -wave superconductivity at absolute zero for the parameter region of actual experimental interest and the particular doping dependences of the condensation energy of superconductivity reflecting particular features of doped Mott insulators. For finite temperatures, on the other hand, the field theoretical slave-boson approximation based on the spin (spinons) and charge (holons) separations and the gauge fields as a glue combining them predicts qualitatively particular features of the existence of characteristic crossover temperatures of the spin singlet of the resonating valence bond ({RVB}) state, {TRVB} and the onset of Bose condensation of holons, {TB}, triggering coherent motion of electrons as convoluted particles of spinons and holons. The considerations based on the gauge field indicate that the onset temperature of superconductivity, Tc, is the lower one of these two, i.e. either {TB} (overdoped cases) or {TRVB} (underdoped cases), respectively. These characteristic features of the ‚Äòphase diagram‚Äô at finite temperatures are in overall agreement with various experimental observations, especially with the existence of spin-gap or pseudo-gap phases. In more detailed examinations of the underdoped region, the antiferromagnetic long-range order and superconductivity show a very intricate relationship at low temperatures depending on the system; they coexist as clarified in the inner layer of Hg-1245 but spin glass states intervene between them in La2‚àí{xSrxCuO}4 ({LSCO}). It is argued that these differences can be attributed to the different degrees of disorder. Actually, theories based on the t‚ÄìJ model have also predicted the coexistence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in the ground state of clean systems. On the other hand, interesting experimental findings of large Nernst effect and ‚ÄòFermi arc‚Äô in {LSCO} and impurity effects in {YBCO} have prompted the necessity of theoretical investigations of electronic states of lightly doped Mott insulators in the presence of strong disorder.},

	abstract = {The presence of different electronic orders other than superconductivity populating the phase diagram of cuprates suggests that they might be the key to disclose the mysteries of this class of materials. In particular charge order in the form of charge density waves ({CDW}), i.e., the incommensurate modulation of electron density in the {CuO}2 planes, is ubiquitous across different families and presents a clear interplay with superconductivity. Until recently, {CDW} had been found to be confined inside a rather small region of the phase diagram, below the pseudogap temperature and the optimal doping. This occurrence might shed doubts on the possibility that such ‚Äúlow temperature phenomenon‚Äù actually rules the properties of cuprates either in the normal or in the superconducting states. However, recent resonant X-ray scattering ({RXS}) experiments are overturning this paradigm. It results that very short-ranged charge modulations permeate a much wider region of the phase diagram, coexisting with {CDW} at lower temperatures and persisting up to temperatures well above the pseudogap opening. Here we review the characteristics of these high temperature charge modulations, which are present in several cuprate families, with similarities and differences. A particular emphasis is put on their dynamical character and on their coupling to lattice and magnetic excitations, properties that can be determined with high resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering ({RIXS}).},

	abstract = {In cuprate superconductors, the doping of carriers into the parent Mott insulator induces superconductivity and various other phases whose characteristic temperatures are typically plotted versus the doping level p. In most materials, p cannot be determined from the chemical composition, but it is derived from the superconducting transition temperature, Tc, using the assumption that the¬†Tc dependence on doping is universal. Here, we present angle-resolved photoemission studies of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+Œ¥, cleaved and annealed in vacuum or in ozone to reduce or increase the doping from the initial value corresponding to Tc‚Äâ=‚Äâ91‚ÄâK. We show that p can be determined from the underlying Fermi surfaces and that in-situ annealing allows mapping of a wide doping regime, covering the superconducting dome and the non-superconducting phase on the overdoped side. Our results show a surprisingly smooth dependence of the inferred Fermi surface with doping. In the highly overdoped regime, the superconducting gap approaches the value of 2Œî0‚Äâ=‚Äâ(4‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1){kBTc}},

	abstract = {The Fermi surface‚Äîthe set of points in momentum space describing gapless electronic excitations‚Äîis a central concept in the theory of metals. In this context, the normal ‚Äòmetallic‚Äô state of the optimally doped high-temperature superconductors is not very unusual: above the superconducting transition temperature, Tc, there is evidence for a large Fermi surface1,2,3, despite the absence of well-defined elementary excitations. In contrast, the normal state of underdoped high-temperature superconductors differs in that there is evidence for a ‚Äòpseudogap‚Äô above Tc (4‚Äì7). Here we examine, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, the temperature dependence of the Fermi surface in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+Œ¥. We find that, on cooling the sample, the pseudogap opens up at different temperatures for different points in momentum space. This leads to an initial breakup of the Fermi surface, at a temperature T*, into disconnected arcs, which then shrink with decreasing temperature before collapsing to the point nodes of the superconducting ground state below Tc. This unusual behaviour, where the Fermi surface does not form a continuous contour in momentum space as in conventional metals, is unprecedented in that it occurs in the absence of long-range order. Moreover, although the superconducting gap below Tc evolves smoothly into the pseudogap above Tc, the pseudogap differs in its unusual temperature-dependent anisotropy, implying an intimate but non-trivial relationship between the pseudogap and the superconducting gap.},

High resolution angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements are carried out on these samples to investigate the evolution of the Fermi surface topology with doping in the normal state. Clear and complete Fermi surfaces are observed and quantitatively analyzed in all of these overdoped Pb-Bi2201 samples. A Lifshitz transition from hole-like Fermi surface to electron-like Fermi surface with increasing doping is observed at a doping level of ‚àº0.35. This transition coincides with the change that the sample undergoes superconducting-to-non-superconducting states.

Under exposure of semiconducting {YBa}2Cu3O6+ùë• films (x‚âÉ0.4) to visible light their resistance is found to decrease drastically. After interrupting the irradiation the resistance persists at this reduced level provided that the temperature is kept below 270 K. When the illumination dose is increased the semiconductorlike behavior of the films progressively changes to that of a metal and a superconductor. Prolonged irradiation leads to complete loss of resistivity below 5 K and simultaneous growth of a diamagnetic moment in the films, revealing pronounced enhancement of their superconducting properties. A slow relaxation of the {PPC} state was found only by warming the sample near to room temperature where it could be described by a thermally activated process with an energy barrier of ‚àº1 {eV}. The observed phenomena are attributed to photoexcitation of extra mobile holes into {CuO}2 planes, allowing a metastable superconducting phase to be initiated. We also discuss feasible microscopic mechanisms of {PPC} in oxygen-deficient Y-Ba-Cu-O films.

Here, we make essential steps toward understanding {PPS}. While the models proposed so far assume that it is caused by a carrier-density increase (photodoping) observed concomitantly, our experiments contradict such conventional belief: we demonstrate that it is instead linked to a photo-induced decrease of the electronic scattering rate. Furthermore, we find that the latter effect and photodoping are completely disconnected and originate from different microscopic mechanisms, since they present different wavelength and oxygen-content dependences as well as strikingly different relaxation dynamics. Besides helping disentangle photodoping, persistent photoconductivity, and {PPS}, our results provide new evidence for the intimate relation between critical temperature and scattering rate, a key ingredient in modern theories on high-temperature superconductivity.},

In this work, we use time-resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy to demonstrate the light-induced renormalization of the Hubbard ùëà in a cuprate superconductor, La1.905‚Å¢Ba0.095‚Å¢{CuO}4. We show that intense femtosecond laser pulses induce a substantial redshift of the upper Hubbard band while leaving the Zhang-Rice singlet energy unaffected. By comparing the experimental data to time-dependent spectra of single- and three-band Hubbard models, we assign this effect to an approximately 140-{meV} reduction of the on-site Coulomb repulsion on the copper sites. Our demonstration of a dynamical Hubbard ùëà renormalization in a copper oxide paves the way to a novel strategy for the manipulation of superconductivity and magnetism as well as to the realization of other long-range-ordered phases in light-driven quantum materials.},

In this study, we investigate the response of a Bi\$\$\_2\$\$Sr\$\$\_2\$\${CaCu}\$\$\_2\$\$O\$\$\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{8\}+ {\textbackslash}delta \}\$\$crystal to the charge redistribution induced by an infrared ultrashort pulse. Element-selective time-resolved core-level photoelectron spectroscopy with a high energy resolution allows disentangling the dynamics of oxygen ions with different coordination and bonds thanks to their different chemical shifts. Our experiment shows that the O¬†1s component arising from the Cu‚ÄìO planes is significantly perturbed by the infrared light pulse. Conversely, the apical oxygen, also coordinated with Sr ions in the Sr-O planes, remains unaffected. This result highlights the peculiar behavior of the electronic structure of the Cu‚ÄìO planes. It also unlocks the way to study the out-of-equilibrium electronic structure of copper-oxide-based high-temperature superconductors by identifying the O¬†1s core-level emission originating from the oxygen ions in the Cu‚ÄìO planes. This ability could be critical to gain information about the strongly-correlated electron ultrafast dynamical mechanisms in the Cu‚ÄìO plane in the normal and superconducting phases.},

We evince that thermal fluctuations are effective only for temperatures near the critical value whereas photoinduced fluctuations scale linearly at low pumping fluence. The minimal energy to fully disrupt the superconducting gap slightly increases when moving off the nodal direction. No evidence of a pseudogap arising from other phenomena than pairing has been detected in the explored region of reciprocal space. On the other hand, a model accounting for the finite pair breaking explains the gap filling both in the near-nodal as well as in the off-nodal direction.

Here we present a study of local symmetry breaking of the lattice structure on the picosecond timescale in the prototype layered dichalcogenide Mott insulator 1T-{TaS}2 using X-ray pair-distribution function measurements. We clearly identify symmetry-breaking polaronic lattice distortions at temperatures well above the ordered phases, and record the evolution of broken symmetry states from 915‚ÄâK to 15‚ÄâK. The data imply that charge ordering is driven by polaron crystallization into a Wigner crystal-like state, rather than Fermi surface nesting or conventional electron-phonon coupling. At intermediate temperatures the local lattice distortions are found to be consistent with a quantum spin liquid state.},

Our results rule out the formation of a central-peak without full phonon softening for the {CDW} transition in 2H-{TaSe}2 and provide evidence for a novel precursor region above the {CDW} transition temperature {TCDW}, which is characterized by an overdamped phonon mode and not detectable in our photoemission experiments. Thus, 2H-{TaSe}2 exhibits structural before electronic static order and emphasizes the important lattice contribution to {CDW} transitions. Our ab-initio calculations explain the interplay of electron-phonon coupling and Fermi surface topology triggering the {CDW} phase transition and predict that the {CDW} soft phonon mode promotes emergent superconductivity near the pressure-driven {CDW} quantum critical point.},

Perspectives on the opportunities of proposed light-induced phenomena, as well as open experimental challenges, are also discussed.},

Trilayer superconductors also exhibit an unusual phase diagram where Tc is roughly constant in the overdoped region, which is in contrast to the decrease usually found in other cuprate superconductors. The mechanism for these two effects remains unclear. Here we report features in the electronic structure of Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+Œ¥ superconductor that helps to explain this issue. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements show the splitting of bands from the three layers, and this allows us to parameterize a three-layer interaction model that effectively describes the data. This, in turn, demonstrates the electronic origin of the maximum Tc and its persistence in the overdoped region. These results are qualitatively consistent with a composite picture where a high Tc is realized in an array of coupled planes with different doping levels such that a high pairing strength is derived from the underdoped planes, whereas a large phase stiffness comes from the optimally or overdoped ones.},

Despite the ubiquity of this phenomenon, it is still poorly understood and attention has instead been mainly focused on the properties of a single {CuO}2 plane. Here we show that the quantum tunnelling of Cooper pairs between the layers2 simply and naturally explains the experimental results, when combined with the recently quantified charge imbalance of the layers3 and the latest notion of a competing order4,5,6,7,8,9 nucleated by this charge imbalance that suppresses superconductivity. We calculate the bell-shaped curve and show that, if materials can be engineered so as to minimize the charge imbalance as n increases, Tc can be raised further.},

	abstract = {We have proposed a T c vs n relationship for multilayered high- T c superconductors from the analysis of {HgBa} 2 Ca n -1 Cu n O y grain-aligned samples containing n =6 to 16 phases. The sample showed a large and sharp superconducting transition at 105 K in its susceptibility vs temperature curve. This means that multilayered {HgBa} 2 Ca n -1 Cu n O y can maintain a high T c at least up to n ‚âà16, otherwise many transitions would have been observed. It is generally believed that the highest T c decreases with n for n ‚â•4‚Äì5 for multilayered superconductors. We conclude that the highest T c is almost constant above about n =5 if the factors reducing T c , such as disorder, are eliminated for multilayered superconductors. This behavior can be explained using an inhomogeneous charge distribution model in multilayered cuprates.},

Contrary to previous reports, in the overdoped ({OD}) regime, we do find a variation in ùëáùëê by increasing the oxygen partial pressure of the postannealing treatment. This variation is less significant than in the bilayer compound Bi2‚Å¢Sr2‚Å¢{CaCu}2‚Å¢O10+ùõø (Bi-2212) and does not follow the universal ùëáùëê vs ùõø relation. Magnetic measurements reveal that increasing ùõø enlarges the field and temperature stability of the Bragg glass phase. These findings imply that the interlayer coupling between Cu-O layers enhances with ùõø. The anisotropy parameter estimated from directional first-penetration field measurements monotonously decreases from 50 in the underdoped ({UD}) to 15 in the {OD} regimes. However, the in-plane penetration depth presents a boomerang-type behavior with ùõø, reaching its minimum value close to optimal doping. These two facts lead to a crossover from a Josephson {OD} to electromagnetic {UD}-dominated coupling of adjacent Cu-O layers in the vicinity of optimal doping.},

In the superconducting state, an anticrossing gap opens between the outer- and inner-{BQP} bands, which we attribute primarily to interlayer single-particle hopping with possible contributions from interlayer Cooper pairing. We find that the ùëë-wave superconducting gap of both {BQP} bands smoothly develops with momentum without an abrupt jump in contrast to a previous {ARPES} study. Hybridization between the {BQPs} also gradually increases in going from the off nodal to the antinodal region, which is explained by the momentum dependence of the interlayer single-particle hopping. As possible mechanisms for the enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature, the hybridization between the {BQPs} as well as the combination of phonon modes of the triple {CuO}2 layers and spin fluctuations represented by a four-well model are discussed.},

Since the interlayer one-electron hopping has little effect on the band structure, we turn to the interlayer pair hopping. The superconductivity in a double-layer Hubbard model with and without the interlayer pair hopping, as studied by solving the Eliashberg equation with the fluctuation exchange approximation, reveals that the interlayer pair hopping acts to increase the pairing interaction and the self-energy simultaneously, but that the former effect supersedes the latter and enhances the superconductivity, along with how the sign of the interlayer off-site pair hopping determines the relative configuration of ùëë waves between the adjacent layers. Study of the triple-layer case with the interlayer pair hopping further reveals that the superconductivity is further enhanced but tends to be saturated toward the triple-layer case.},

On the other hand, the superfluid density, which controls the stiffness of the system to phase fluctuations, vanishes as x‚Üí0, and increases with increasing x. Optimal Tc is obtained at a crossover from a phase ordering dominated regime at small x to a pairing dominated regime at large x.

In the {BCS}-Eliashberg mean-field theory1, which is a very good approximation for conventional metals, the phase of the order parameter is un-important for determining the value of the transition temperature Tc and the change of many physical properties brought about by the transition. Here we argue that superconductors with low super-conducting carrier density (such as the organic and high-Tc oxide superconductors) are characterized by a relatively small phase 'stiffness9 and poor screening, both of which imply a significantly larger role for phase fluctuations. As a consequence, in these mat-erials the transition to the superconducting state may not display typical mean-field behaviour, and phase fluctuations, both classical and quantum, may have a significant influence on low-temperature properties. For some quasi-two-dimensional materials, notably underdoped high-temperature superconductors, the onset of long-range phase order controls the gross value of Tc as well as its systematic variation from one material to another.},

Until now, integer Chern insulators have been experimentally demonstrated in several systems at zero magnetic field3‚Äì8, whereas fractional Chern insulators have been reported in only graphene-based systems under a finite magnetic field9,10. The emergence of semiconductor moir√© materials11, which support tunable topological flat bands12,13, provides an opportunity to realize fractional Chern insulators13‚Äì16. Here we report thermodynamic evidence of both integer and fractional Chern insulators at zero magnetic field in small-angle twisted bilayer {MoTe}2 by combining the local electronic compressibility and magneto-optical measurements. At hole filling factor ŒΩ‚Äâ=‚Äâ1 and 2/3, the system is incompressible and spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry. We show that they are integer and fractional Chern insulators, respectively, from the dispersion of the state in the filling factor with an applied magnetic field. We further demonstrate electric-field-tuned topological phase transitions involving the Chern insulators. Our findings pave the way for the demonstration of quantized fractional Hall conductance and anyonic excitation and braiding17 in semiconductor moir√© materials.},

	abstract = {The emergence of superconductivity and correlated insulators in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene ({MATBG}) has raised the intriguing possibility that its pairing mechanism is distinct from that of conventional superconductors1‚Äì4, as described by the Bardeen‚ÄìCooper‚ÄìSchrieffer ({BCS}) theory. However, recent studies have shown that superconductivity persists even when Coulomb interactions are partially screened5,6. This suggests that pairing in {MATBG} might be conventional in nature and a consequence of the large density of states of its flat bands. Here we combine tunnelling and Andreev reflection spectroscopy with a scanning tunnelling microscope to observe several key experimental signatures of unconventional superconductivity in {MATBG}. We show that the tunnelling spectra below the transition temperature Tc are inconsistent with those of a conventional s-wave superconductor, but rather resemble those of a nodal superconductor with an anisotropic pairing mechanism. We observe a large discrepancy between the tunnelling gap ŒîT, which far exceeds the mean-field {BCS} ratio (with 2{ŒîT}/{kBTc}‚Äâ{\textasciitilde}‚Äâ25), and the gap Œî{AR} extracted from Andreev reflection spectroscopy (2{ŒîAR}/{kBTc}‚Äâ{\textasciitilde}‚Äâ6). The tunnelling gap persists even when superconductivity is suppressed, indicating its emergence from a pseudogap phase. Moreover, the pseudogap and superconductivity are both absent when {MATBG} is aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. These findings and other observations reported here provide a preponderance of evidence for a non-{BCS} mechanism for superconductivity in {MATBG}.},

Together with the previously reported reverse effect, the photoinduced insulator-to-metal transition, it is found that the relative stability of the metallic and insulating phases interchanges around 80 K in the middle of a very wide hysteresis loop, which is a manifestation of the large potential barrier due to the long-range elastic energy.

We present measurements of the low-temperature in-plane resistivity of several highly doped La2‚Äì{xSrxCuO}4 single crystals in which the superconductivity had been stripped away by using high magnetic fields. In contrast to other quantum critical systems, the resistivity varies linearly with temperature over a wide doping range with a gradient that scales monotonically with the superconducting transition temperature. It is maximal at a critical doping level (pc) ‚àº 0.19 at which superconductivity is most robust. Moreover, its value at pc corresponds to the onset of quasi-particle incoherence along specific momentum directions, implying that the interaction that first promotes high-temperature superconductivity may ultimately destroy the very quasi-particle states involved in the superconducting pairing.},

	abstract = {Efforts to understand the microscopic origin of superconductivity in the cuprates are dependent on knowledge of the normal state. The Hall number in the low-temperature, high-field limit {nH}(0) has a particular importance because, within conventional transport theory, it is simply related to the number of charge carriers, so its evolution with doping gives crucial information about the nature of the charge transport. Here we report a study of the high-field Hall coefficient of the single-layer cuprates Tl2Ba2CuO6+Œ¥ (Tl2201) and (Pb/La)-doped Bi2Sr2CuO6+Œ¥ (Bi2201), which shows how {nH}(0) evolves in the overdoped‚Äîso-called strange metal‚Äîregime of cuprates. We find that {nH}(0) increases smoothly from p to 1‚Äâ+‚Äâp, where p is the number of holes doped into the parent insulating state, over a wide range of doping. The evolution of {nH} correlates with the emergence of the anomalous linear-in-temperature term in the low-temperature in-plane resistivity. The results could suggest that quasiparticle decoherence extends to dopings well beyond the pseudogap regime.},

	abstract = {The three central phenomena of cuprate (copper oxide) superconductors are linked by a common doping level p*‚Äîat which the enigmatic pseudogap phase ends and the resistivity exhibits an anomalous linear dependence on temperature, and around which the superconducting phase forms a dome-shaped area in the phase diagram1. However, the fundamental nature of p* remains unclear, in particular regarding whether it marks a true quantum phase transition. Here we measure the specific heat C of the cuprates Eu-{LSCO} and Nd-{LSCO} at low temperature in magnetic fields large enough to suppress superconductivity, over a wide doping range2 that includes p*. As a function of doping, we find that Cel/T is strongly peaked at p*¬†(where Cel is the electronic contribution to C) and exhibits a log(1/T) dependence as temperature T tends to zero. These are the classic thermodynamic signatures of a quantum critical point3‚Äì5, as observed in heavy-fermion6 and iron-based7 superconductors at the point where their antiferromagnetic phase comes to an end. We conclude that the pseudogap phase of cuprates ends at a quantum critical point, the associated fluctuations of which are probably involved in d-wave pairing and the anomalous scattering of charge carriers.},

At present, the highest reported values of Tc for non-copper-oxide bulk superconductivity are 33‚ÄâK in electron-doped {CsxRbyC}60 (ref. 2), and 30‚ÄâK in Ba1-{xKxBiO}3 (ref. 3).

Here we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in magnesium diboride, {MgB}2.

Previous experience with similar compounds containing bismuth and thallium instead of mercury suggested that even higher transition temperatures might be achieved in mercury-based compounds with more than one {CuO}2 layer per unit cell. Here we provide support for this conjecture, with the discovery of superconductivity above 130 K in a material containing {HgBa}2Ca2Cu3O1+x (with three {CuO}2 layers per unit cell), {HgBa}2CaCu2O6+x (with two {CuO}2 layers) and an ordered superstructure comprising a defined sequence of the unit cells of these phases.

Other interesting effects of 3-dimensional dispersions include ‚Äòghost‚Äô photoemission peaks outside the Fermi surface and finite peak width at the Fermi level.

Conventional photoemission accesses binding energies of electronic states and their momentum dispersion. The use of femtosecond laser pulses in pump-probe experiments allows obtaining direct insights to the energy and momentum dependence of ultrafast dynamics. This article introduces the elementary interaction processes and emphasizes recent work performed in this rapidly developing field. Decay processes in the low excitation limit are addressed, where electrons decay according to their interaction with carriers in equilibrium. Here, hot electron relaxation in epitaxial metallic film is reviewed. In the limit of an intense optical excitation, scattering of the excited electrons among each other establishes a non-equilibrium state. Results on charge-density wave materials and the effect of coherent nuclear motion on the electronic structure, which can break low symmetry ground states, are discussed.

	abstract = {In the last two decades non-equilibrium spectroscopies have evolved from avant-garde studies to crucial tools for expanding our understanding of the physics of strongly correlated materials. The possibility of obtaining simultaneously spectroscopic and temporal information has led to insights that are complementary to (and in several cases beyond) those attainable by studying the matter at equilibrium. From this perspective, multiple phase transitions and new orders arising from competing interactions are benchmark examples where the interplay among electrons, lattice and spin dynamics can be disentangled because of the different timescales that characterize the recovery of the initial ground state. For example, the nature of the broken-symmetry phases and of the bosonic excitations that mediate the electronic interactions, eventually leading to superconductivity or other exotic states, can be revealed by observing the sub-picosecond dynamics of impulsively excited states. Furthermore, recent experimental and theoretical developments have made it possible to monitor the time-evolution of both the single-particle and collective excitations under extreme conditions, such as those arising from strong and selective photo-stimulation. These developments are opening the way for new, non-equilibrium phenomena that can eventually be induced and manipulated by short laser pulses. Here, we review the most recent achievements in the experimental and theoretical studies of the non-equilibrium electronic, optical, structural and magnetic properties of correlated materials. The focus will be mainly on the prototypical case of correlated oxides that exhibit unconventional superconductivity or other exotic phases. The discussion will also extend to other topical systems, such as iron-based and organic superconductors, and charge-transfer insulators. With this review, the dramatically growing demand for novel experimental tools and theoretical methods, models and concepts, will clearly emerge. In particular, the necessity of extending the actual experimental capabilities and the numerical and analytic tools to microscopically treat the non-equilibrium phenomena beyond the simple phenomenological approaches represents one of the most challenging new frontiers in physics.},

\chapter{Time \& angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy}

The development and understanding of quantum materials play a huge role in the advancement of modern technologies.
In many of these materials, interactions and correlations of electrons have a huge impact on the general material properties such as the formation of exotic phases.
Understanding what the impact of the electrons on these phases is and how the interactions can lead to the emergent phenomena is crucial.

Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy stands out here as a unique technique, capable of measuring the single particle wavefuntion and by extension mapping out the band structure in the full 3D Brillouin zone (BZ).

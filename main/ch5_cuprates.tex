\section{Photoinduced change of Fermi momenta k$_F$}
\label{sec:larger_effect}

In this section I will present the fundamental changes to the band structure after pulse excitation and the discussion of the changes will be based on the description of the electronic structure at equilibrium of optimally doped \ce{Bi}2212 (see Sec. \ref{sec:bscco_general}).
All measurements performed in this chapter were done at a temperature of $\approx$\qty{70}{\kelvin}, within the superconducting phase of the material.
The Harmonium beamline \cite{arrell_harmonium_2017} was used to probe the band structure with a photon energy of \qty{28}{\electronvolt}.
The excitation is created by an infrared pump pulse with an energy of \qty{1.55}{\electronvolt}, which is resonant with the charge transfer gap.

The discussion of the spectral features in this section will be centered around the quasiparticle peaks and the parabola like feature and how they behave under intense light excitation.
For this purpose the sample was oriented in a way, that the anti-node is parallel the detector slit, resulting in a Fermi surface (FS) as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fs_cut} (a).
A cut in the region between node and anti-node is selected, which is marked by a black dashed line in Fig. \ref{fig:fs_cut} (a), and the corresponding bandmap is displayed in \ref{fig:fs_cut} (b).
The bandmap shows the features discused in Sec. \ref{sec:bscco_general}, containing the quasiparticle peaks close to $E_F$, the parabolic low energy feature, the high energy \ce{Cu} d-bands, and the incoherent "waterfall" feature connecting the two.
Here it is important to note, that it is not possible to observe the superconducting gap in the measurements presented in this chapter due to the relatively low energy resolution of Harmonium ($\approx$\qty{100}{\milli\electronvolt}), which for the remaining spectral weight even close to the anti-node.
Additionally this results in the observation of the quasiparticle peak at the Fermi level with a corresponding Fermi momentum $k_F$.

	\label{fig:fs_cut}
\end{figure}

Determining the correct $k_F$ points will be crucial for the discussion of this chapter.
Therefore it is important to ensure that Fermi surface is well centered and aligned with the analyzer slit.
The old manipulator of the ARPES setup in the LACUS facility did not have a dedicated in plane axis for the alignment of the polar component of the sample.
Instead the sample was manually rotated in a cylindrical hole with the help of a wobble stick, which resulted in a typical error of $\pm$\qty{5}{\degree}.
The Fermi arcs where fitted by Lorentzian peaks to correct for any error in the polar degree of freedom, as well as any tilt offsets resulting from a sample termination which is not perfectly parallel to the manipulator surface.

The fitting procedure consisted of extracting a momentum distribution curve (MDC) in a range of $\pm$\qty{100}{\electronvolt} for various momentum points along $k_x$ and $k_y$ and fitting a double Lorentzian to each MDC, essentially extracting the $k_F$ points for $\pm k_y$ and $\pm k_x$.
From these $k_F$ points, the coordinate offsets for the polar ($\chi$), tilt ($\Theta$) and rotational scan axis ($\Phi$) are calculated and applied to the Fermi surface.
This procedure is then repeated until the FS  is well centered.
With the help of the corrected FS it is possible to accurately determine the parallel momentum component at which the cut in \ref{fig:fs_cut} (b) was taken.
The bandmap was measured at a manipulator angle of \qty{-13}{\degree}.
From the FS centering the offset in the $\Phi$ coordinate was determined to be \qty{-3.95}{\degree}, which results in a scan angle of \qty{-9.05}{\degree}.
Converting this to the corresponding momentum coordinate results in a parallel momentum component of \qty{-0.423}{\angstrom^{-1}}.

\begin{figure}[th!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/bi2212/EDM_collection}
	\caption{The figure shows a collection of bandmaps all taken at the same parallel momentum, which is marked by the black dashed line in Fig. \ref{fig:fs_cut} (a). Each bandmap represents a scan with a different pump fluence, from the pump being blocked to a pump fluence of \qty{3.33}{\milli\joule/\centi\meter\squared}. The evolution shows a closing of the parabola which also shows in the quasiparticle peaks moving closer to \qty{0}{\per\angstrom}. Additionally the leading edge of the \ce{Cu} d-bands (at \qty{1.2}{\electronvolt}) shifts slightly upwards with increasing fluence. At a fluences above \qty{1.74}{\milli\joule/\centi\meter\squared} a slight upward shift of the Fermi level is visible.}
	\label{fig:edm_collection}
\end{figure}

The cut at \qty{-0.423}{\angstrom^{-1}} was selected to investigate the the out of equilibrium response in the high pump fluence regime.
For this reason a pump fluence dependence was performed in a fluence range from \qtyrange{0}{3.33}{\milli\joule/\centi\meter\squared}, and the changes of the band structure were recorded.
The corresponding bandmaps are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:edm_collection}.
In these bandmaps clear changes to the parabolic feature are visible, as well as changes to the $k_F$ points and the onset of the \ce{Cu} d-bands.
Here, a continuous closing of the parabola can be observed.
Additionally, the change in the Fermi momenta becomes especially apparent when plotting the MDC as a function of fluence (see Fig. \ref{fig:fluence_map}).
This colormap shows the Fermi momenta for positive and negative $k_\parallel$ moving towards the \qty{0}{\per\angstrom} point, with the $k_F$ points at positive momenta showing a stronger change.
The asymmetric $k_F$ change is due to the planar offset $\chi$.

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/bi2212/MDC_fits}
	\caption{The figure shows a collection of the MDCs corresponding to the bandsmaps in Fig. \ref{fig:edm_collection}. The MDCs is a result of the integration at $E_F$ in a $\pm$\qty{100}{\milli\electronvolt} window. Triple or Double Lorentzians were used to fit the peak position. The two outer Lorentzians correspond to the position of the quasiparticle peak, and the third corresponds to the Umklappband crossing the spectrum (see Fig. \ref{fig:fs_cut} (a)). The MDCs are fitted for a fluence between \qtyrange{0}{3.33}{\milli\joule/\centi\meter\squared} with the individual plots labeled as such. The distance of the quasiparticle peaks $\Delta k_\parallel$ is given in the respective MDCs.}
	\label{fig:mdc_fits}
\end{figure}

Apart from visually observing the changes to the bandmaps it is important to quantify the pump induced changes to the parabola, which can be done by extracting the position of the $k_F$ points.
For this the MDCs are plotted in a $\pm$\qty{100}{\milli\electronvolt} range around $E_F$ (see Fig. \ref{fig:mdc_fits}).
Two peaks are visible in each MDC, corresponding to the $k_F$ point at positive and negative momentum.
The MDC is then fitted by a triple Lorentzian, two Lorentzians corresponding to the two $k_F$ points, and a third to account for the Umklappband crossing the anti-nodal region (see Fig. \ref{fig:fs_cut}).
Repeating this process for each fluence steps reveal a linear relation between the distance of the $k_F$ points and the used pump fluence, which can be seen in figure \ref{fig:fluence_map} (b).
The linear trend can not only be observed in the peak distance, but also in the individual peak position (see. Fig. \ref{fig:fluence_map} (b) and (c)).
Figure \ref{fig:fluence_map} (c) shows on top of that the asymmetric change of positive and negative peaks, as discussed before.

A linear but asymmetric change for each peak can be observed, which is also visible in the fluence map of (a).}
	\label{fig:fluence_map}
\end{figure}

Similar observations have been made previously in bandmaps recorded at the nodal position \cite{bibid} rameau.
In these measurements the shift of the Fermi momenta was considerably smaller for similar pump fluences.
This difference hints at a possible momentum dependence of the effect, which is a known fact regarding the FS changes for differently doped \ce{Bi}2212 samples, and motivates studies a larger momentum space.

\section{Nodal vs anti-nodal behavior}
\label{sec:angle}

\ce{Bi}2212 is known for the anisotropy between the nodal and anit-nodal regions, which is clearly evident from the d-wave type superconductivty, which results in a superconducting gap at the anti-node but not at the node.
The anisotropic is furthermore visible in the chemical doping dependent evolution of the Fermi surface.
Here, the Fermi arcs change significantly in the region close to the anti-node, while remaining largely unchanged in the nodal area.
In this section I want to explore if a similar anisotropic behavior can be observed when investigating the light induced effects presented in the previous section (Sec. \ref{sec:larger_effect}).

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/bi2212/fermi_map_ang_dep}
	\caption{The figure shows the FS of Bi2212 as in Fig. \ref{fig:fs_cut}. The black dashed lines indicate the series of cuts for which a fluence dependence was recorded.}
	\label{fig:fermimap_angdep}
\end{figure}

A series of cuts between the nodal and anti-nodal region is analyzed, in order to address the question of anisotropy.
The cuts were performed at parallel momentum $k_p$ of \qtylist{0.41;0.452;0.494;0.535}{\per\angstrom}.
Figure \ref{fig:fermimap_angdep} shows the same FS as before in Fig. \ref{fig:fs_cut} (a), with the black dashed lines indicating the $k_p$ position of the selected cuts.
For each cut a fluence dependence similar to the case in section \ref{sec:larger_effect} was measured, with the fluences ranging between \qtyrange{0.09}{1.15}{\milli\joule/\centi\meter\squared}.
The resulting bandmaps of this fluence and momentum dependent study are shown in figure \ref{fig:effect_angle}.

For each cut a series of fluences between \qtyrange{0.09}{1.15}{\milli\joule/\centi\meter\squared} is shown.}
	\label{fig:effect_angle}
\end{figure}

Similarly to the previous case, a closing of the parabola can be seen for the higher momentum cuts, whereas in the case of \qty{0.41}{\per\angstrom}, barely any change is visible.
In addition, a small shift of the leading edge is again visible for all four cases.
The same analysis as in the previous section can be performed for each of the momentum cuts, with an MDC taken at $E_F$ in $\pm$\qty{100}{\milli\electronvolt} range, and fitting triple Lorentzian to the resulting MDCS to extract the peak positions.
This analysis quantifies the shift of the quasiparticle peak and closing of the parabola.
In particular it shows that as the fluence increases a decrease in the peak distance can be observed for each of the cut.
The amount at which the distance decreases changes substantially between the cut closest to the node and the cut closest to the anti-node.
At a parallel momentum of \qty{0.535}{\per\angstrom} the observed change is the most significant with a $20\%$ reduction in the peak distance.
In the other cuts this change is reduced to a $5\%$, $3\%$ and $2.7\%$ reduction respectively, when the fluence is increased from \qty{0.09}{\milli\joule/\centi\meter\squared} to \qty{1.15}{\milli\joule/\centi\meter\squared}, but remains noticeable for all cases.
The peak distances for each momentum cut can be plotted as a function of fluence (see Fig. \ref{fig:angdep_deltak}).
This plot reveals the increasing movement of the quasiparticle peaks, when approaching the anti-node.
Additionally it shows that for each momentum cut, the closing of the distance between the two peaks remains linearly with the used pump fluence, as it was the case in the previous section.

From the MDC fits it is is possible to locate the specific momentum point in the FS for each of the peaks.
To cross check that no alignment or fitting errors are adopted, the data points of the \qty{0.09}{\milli\joule/\centi\meter\squared} fluence are compared to previously published literature data of optimally doped \ce{Bi}2212 FS.
This comparison clearly shows that the data points extracted from the fluence series agree well with the literature data.
The data points for each cut at each fluence are plotted together in constant energy map, together with the literature data, but instead of showing the full Fermi surface here, a zoom of the anti-nodal region (see Fig. \ref{fig:FS_points_zoom} (a)) and the nodal (see Fig. \ref{fig:FS_points_zoom} (b)) region are displayed respectively.
The zoom is chosen to better visualize the small movement of the quasiparticles due to the pump excitation.
Comparing the zoomed in areas of the FS with published data on the FS of differently doped \ce{Bi}2212 samples, one can see the similarity between the data points of increased pump fluence and the behavior of the FS observed when increasing the hole doping via chemical doping of the compound \cite{} lanzare revisiting the FS nautre.

The evolution of the quasiparticle peaks at different momenta is one of the key findings presented in this chapter and represents the main observable from the data.
Further analysis in this chapter will be based on these $k_F$ points.
It is important to note here, that scans at even higher momenta (closer to the anti-node) were performed to increase the amount of data points, but it was not possible to obtain reliable MDCs.
The main reason for this lies in the broad distribution of the spectral intensity of the incoherent quasiparticle peaks, that make up the Fermi arcs, due to the presence of the pseudo gap \cite{bibid} Norman, M. R et al., Nature 392, 157 (1998).
This broadening, paired with the relatively low energy resolution of the Harmonium beamline made it impossible to resolve the two distinct peaks and reliably extract their momentum coordinate.
In one of the next sections I will present a full reconstruction of the FS based upon these four momentum cuts, to better describe the evolution of the material under intense femtosecond light illumination.
But before this is attempted, an additional quantity can be extracted from the bandmaps which will help immensely in the description of the Fermi surface evolution later.


\section{Distinguishing effects of photodoping and screening}

As mentioned at the end of the last section, apart from the quasiparticle peak movement, additional information can be gained from the fluence dependent series of bandmaps.
When simply looking at the change of the $k_F$ points, keeping in mind that those are the endpoints terminating the parabolic dispersion, two distinct causes could result in the change of the observed momentum.
The first possibility is that an actual shift of $k$ across the parabolic feature causes the quasiparticle to appear at momenta closer to \qty{0}{\per\angstrom}.
A second possibility could lie in an upwards shift of the whole band structure, which would result in smaller $k_F$ if the same energy slice is chosen for the MDC used in the peak fit procedure.

While both of these causes would show the same result, the movement of the $k_F$ points to the center, the physical cause is very distinct.
Screening effects are are a reduction of the electric field, caused by mobile charges, as experienced by the system.
A change in screening could be caused by an induced charge imbalance, which would result in a change of the Coulomb potential.
In the band structure such a charge imbalance would result in a rearrangement of the momentum of the charges.

Instead changes due to an energy shift of band structure could be caused by two different effects.
The first possible effect which typically changes the observed energy is called space charge effect.
This effect is the result of a too dense cloud of photoelectrons, being emitted at the same time, which due to Coulomb repulsion results in a broadening and shift of the detected photoelectron energy.
A detailed description of this effect can be found in section \ref{sec:space_charge}.
To ensure that the energy shift is not caused by space charge effects, the Fermi level is meticulously checked for any shifts, since the space charge effect would also influence the detected Fermi level.
This is generally done by integrating over a momentum range in which no band is observed, in this case the region from \qtyrange{0.4}{0.5}{\per\angstrom} is summed.
The resulting energy distribution curve (EDC) is fitted by a Fermi-Dirac equation, which is given by
\begin{equation}
	I = \left[ c + \frac{1}{e^{(E-E_F)/k_BT}+1} \right] * g(E,\Delta E)
\end{equation}
with explain formula.
An exemplary EDC with the corresponding fit can be found in Fig. \ref{fig:fermi_fit_bi2212} (a).
Additionally, Fig. \ref{fig:fermi_fit_bi2212} (b) shows the extracted Fermi level, for a selected fluence dependent measurement series.
The figure shows, that the Fermi level stays approximately at the same value, considering an energy resolution of \qty{150}{\milli\electronvolt}.
Only for the highest fluence of \qty{1.15}{\milli\joule/\centi\meter\squared} can a broadening and small energy shift be observed.

(b) Shows the same EDC for all recorded fluences as a colormap. Red markers shows the center of the Fermi level as determined from the respective fit.}
	\label{fig:fermi_fit_bi2212}
\end{figure}

A second possible effect, responsible for shifting the band structure upwards, is called photodoping.
It is not uncommon to observe this effect in trARPES measurements.
This effect is caused by a change in the number of electrons occupying states in the material.
Here it is to note, that in ARPES measurements the whole system is electronically grounded and the Fermi level is fixed.
Therefore, if a change in the occupation number occurs, a up- or downward shift of the band structure relative to $E_F$ will be observed.
An upwards shift band structure, which would result in a shift of the quasiparticle peak towards the center, is the result of a lowered chemical potential, which means a reduction electrons occupying the electronic states of the material.
In this section I will discuss how the upwards band shift can be quantified and why it can't be the only responsible contribution to the shift of the quasiparticle peaks.

	\caption{The figure shows part of the bandmap, with a zoom of (a) the parabolic feature at $E_F$ and (b) of the \ce{Cu} d-band. A step function broadened by a Gaussian is used to determine the leading edge of each feature. Red markers indicate the extracted center of the edge. Both bandmaps show the position of the leading edge for a pump fluence of \qty{0.09}{\milli\joule/\centi\meter\squared}.}
	\label{fig:mu_center}
\end{figure}

Multiple different spectral features could technically be used to quantify the photodoping effect, but the lower energy resolution restricts the analysis to three different options, the bottom of the parabolic dispersion, as well as the center and the edge of the \ce{Cu} d-band.
In each case a step function, broadened by a Gaussian distribution is fitted to determine the leading edge of the respective feature, and the evolution of the energy coordinate is tracked as a function of fluence.
Fig. \ref{fig:mu_center} shows how the feature positions are determined for each case, with (a) showing the parabolic feature and the fit of the bottom of the parabola, and (b) showing the fitted position of the \ce{Cu} d-band.
In the first case the bottom of the parabola has to be accurately determined, which is done by taking the center of the two quasiparticle peaks.
The fit of the the broadened step function the extracts the position of the leading edge as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:mu_center} (a).
This method assumes that the feature is actually parabolic, which in reality is not exactly true as there is a asymmetric spectral weight distribution.
Additionally, the asymmetric closing of the parabola due to the slight planar misalignment (see Sec. \ref{sec:larger_effect}) makes this problem worse.

Therefore using the leading edge of the \ce{Cu} d-bands presents a better alternative, which additionally benefits from a higher signal to noise ratio.
For this case the momentum range is divided into \qty{10}{\per\angstrom} sized bin, to further improve the signal quality and the center position of the leading edge is extracted with the help of a broadened step function, across the whole momentum range.
The extracted position can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:mu_center} (b), which shows a curved distribution of centers, which is relatively flat under the incoherent waterfall feature.
For this reason the leading edge of the \ce{Cu} d-band center is used to quantify the shift of the feature as a function of pump fluence.
The other discussed features will be analyzed in the same to compare if the shifts qualitatively, making sure that the shift is even across the band structure.

\begin{figure}[b!]

		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{bi2212/mu_shift_all}
		\caption{}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{}
	\label{fig:mu_shift}
\end{figure}

The analysis of the leading edge shift as a function of fluence reveal a shift that is linear with the pump fluence and is approximately \qty{40}{\milli\electronvolt} in amplitude for the maximum fluence of \qty{1.15}{\milli\joule/\centi\meter\squared} (see Fig. \ref{fig:mu_shift}).
Additionally, figure \ref{fig:mu_shift} (a) shows that both the center and sides of the \ce{Cu} d-band shift by the same amount.
This is also the case for the parabolic feature apart from the data point at the highest fluence, at which point the feature becomes less clear in general and the fit procedure fails.
The fitting error for the parabolic feature is also significantly larger than for the \ce{Cu} d-band.

In general, the analysis shows clearly an upwards shift of the band structure, which depends linearly on the fluence and that behavior is similar across the observed bandmap.
Applying a linear regression to the datapoints reveals a chemical potential shift of \qty{33}{\frac{\milli\electronvolt}{\milli\joule/\centi\meter\squared}}.
This combined with the fact that the Fermi level does not show a linear upwards shift means that the chemical potential $\mu$ changes and scales linearly with the fluence.
Therefore, photodoping plays an important part when trying to understand the out of equilibrium dynamics.
Now it is important to understand if photodoping is the dominating or even sole cause of the observed quasiparticle shift or if screening effects are important to consider as well.

\section{Modeling the Fermi surface: A tight binding approach}

This section will address the the role of screening for the observed quasiparticle shift after light irradiation.
To answer this question I will use the results on the photodoping and try to recreate the FS within a tight binding approach, which is a standard, but phenomenological way of plotting the FS of \ce{Bi}2212 and performs well in a large doping range.
At the beginning the tight binding model will be recreated with literature values for the unpumped case, and small changes will be introduced to account for the out of equilibrium FS for the different fluences.

The tight binding model generally includes a series of cosine terms, with their amplitude depending on the hopping parameters.
In the model used here, terms up to the 3rd order are used and the model is described by
\begin{equation}
	E = \frac{\mu}{t} + \frac{1}{2} \left(\cos(k_xa)+\cos(k_ya)\right) + \frac{t'}{t} \cos(k_xa)\cos(k_ya) + \frac{t''}{2t} \left(\cos(2k_xa)+\cos(2k_ya)\right)
\end{equation}
with the nearest neighbor (NN) hopping parameter $t$, the next NN (NNN) hopping parameter $t'$ and the second (NNN) hopping parameter $t''$, the chemical potential $\mu$ and the lattice parameter $a=\qty{3.83}{\angstrom}$, reflecting the \ce{Cu}-\ce{Cu} distance.
Higher order terms, especially terms accounting for the splitting of bonding and anti-bonding bands were ignored, as it is not possible to individually resolve the two branches with the Harmonium beamline.

Additional assumption were made to reduce the amount of free parameters in the model.
First $t'$ and $t''$ were treated as fixed parameters, with their value taken from previous publications \cite{}.
Second, the chemical potential is treated the same way as $t'$ and $t''$ for the unpumped case, with the value taken as well from the reference.
For any higher fluence $\mu$ is still treated as a fixed parameter, but the value is updates in each step according to the relative change extracted in the previous chapter.
This leaves only the nearest neighbor hopping parameter as a free fitting parameter for each fluence.

In order to recreate the full FS additional points were added to the plot based on the four-fold symmetry of lattice.
In a first step, the literature data was fitted with the using the fixed values as mentioned before and leaving $t$ as a free parameter, in order to evaluate the consistency of the methodology.
The resulting values were then used to fit the datapoints for the case of \qty{0.09}{ \qty{1.15}{\milli\joule/\centi\meter\squared}}.
Fig. \ref{} shows the result of this fit.
A comparison with the literature data shows a good agreement between the fit and literature data.
From this point onward the fixed parameters were treated as stated before.
In addition the fit result for $t$ for a specific fluence is then used as a guess parameter for the next higher fluence.
This way the FS is reconstructed for the full fluence dependence step-by-step.
The full reconstructed FS evolution is shown in Fig. \ref{} together with the datapoints.

From the figure it becomes very clear that the FS is modified both in terms of curvature as well as in size of the enclosed area.
For the lowest fluence of \qty{0.09}{\milli\joule/\centi\meter\squared}, the FS encloses the area around the ($\pi$,$\pi$)-point and forms a hole-pocket.
Increasing the fluence results in a significant modulation at the anti-node ($\pi$,0), as previously observed in section \ref{sec:angle}.
Increasing the fluence to  \qty{0.88}{\milli\joule/\centi\meter\squared} results in a change if the enclosed FS area from being centered around ($\pi$,$\pi$) to being centered around $\Gamma$.
This results in a transformation of the enclosed area from a hole- to an electron-pocket.
Typically, this transformation is referred to as a Lifshitz transition, which is a well known phenomenon for various hole-doped cuprates, including \ce{Bi}2212, \ce{Bi}2201, LSCO and \ce{Nd}-LSCO \cite{} draft.
At equilibrium the Lifshitz transition occurs when increasing the hole-doping.
In \ce{Bi}2212, this transition happens is at a hole doping of $p=0.22$ \cite{} 35 draft.

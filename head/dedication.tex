\begin{center}
    To my parents, \\
    who sparked and fostered my interest in science from a young age, \\
    endured all my shortcomings, \\
    and supported me in becoming the person I am today. \\
    To my family and friends, \\
    I am infinitely grateful for your unwavering support, joy, and love, \\
    which have enabled me to pursue this path.
\end{center}

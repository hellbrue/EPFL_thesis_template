    	What does it mean to live a small, fragile and finite life \\
	 in an infinite universe?\\

\begin{center}
    To my parents, \\
    who from a young age sparked and fostered my interest in science, \\
    endured all my shortcomings, \\
    and supported me to be the person I am today. \\
    To my family and to my friends, \\
    I am infinitely grateful for your unwavering support, joy, and love, \\
    which have enabled me to pursue my path.
\end{center}

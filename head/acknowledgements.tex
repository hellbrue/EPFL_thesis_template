Four years as PhD student... how the time passes.
This has most certainly been the most intense time of life, a roller coaster with all its high highs and low lows.
I am happy to have had this opportunity, I have learned so many things, about science, about society, about friendship and about myself.
It is a journey for which I have to express my most sincerest thanks to many people.\hfill\break

First, I want to thank my two supervisors Henrik M. R{\o}nnow and Fabrizio Carbone, which gave me the opportunity to come to Switzerland and work in there labs.
I genuinely enjoyed every scientific discussion and the honest feedback, as well as the exchange of ideas.
I am grateful that I could always ask for advice or talk about anything that was bothering me, which is not a given.
It speaks volumes that both of you created great, positive and motivating environments in your research groups.\hfill\break

I would also like to thank Uwe Bovensiepen, Claude Monney and Gregor Jotzu for accepting the invitation to be on my doctoral committee and all the discussions, interesting questions and exchanges we had during the defense, which sparked some new ideas.
I also want to thank Paolo De Los Rios for accepting the role as the president of the jury.\hfill\break

Now all of this would not have been possible without the colleagues I was able to spent time with over the years.
A big thank you goes to all members of LQM.
It has not been easy for me to participate on an everyday basis, being in two groups brings it own sets of challenges.
But despite this I always felt integrated, especially during the group retreats, where I felt like I would spent every day with all of you.
I want to thank Alexia, Davor and Ellen in particular, who helped me especially in beginnings where I felt lost.
I also want to thank Ivica for integrating me into the group meetings, as well as Daniil for the many ARPES related discussions.\hfill\break

But as I said, I was lucky enough to be part of two groups.
First I want to thank Michele, who was not only a great colleague, always helpful and full of knowledge but also basically a third supervisor.
Thank you for initially integrating me into the ARPES team and helping me learn as much as I could, and always lending an ear if needed, as well as writing corrections for this thesis. I also want to thank the rest of the ARPES team that I was able to work with over the years. Thank you Ji, Alberto, Fei, Jona and Sophie.

I also am grateful to Francesco, for the countless discussion, shared beamtimes, schools and conferences, the long nights and always supporting me when needed, even if it sometimes meant to argue with me.

Siham, thank you for working with me over all the years. Even if it was not always easy I am grateful for the opportunities you gave me, the lessons about cuprates and all other discussions over the years, I enjoyed listening to your point of view.

I want to thank Simone for the long nights by the lake, the philosophical discussion and for being there whenever needed. And thank you for making such a good spongey cake for me!

To Thom, thank you for always listening to me when needed, organizing group outings and BBQs and science discussions.
To Veronica, Benoit, Alexey, Ivan, Paolo U., Rémi, Paolo C., Hui-Yuan and Bruce who I was able to share most of my time as a PhD with, thank you all for your friendship and for the time spent together at various conferences, dinner nights, group activities and of course no to forget Carlo Forte.
I also want to thank Kjeld, Samuele, Antoine, Beatrice, Rahul, as well as Leonor and Chris, for your help over the years and making LUMES what it is.

Four years as PhD student... how the time passes.
This journey has been the most intense and transformative chapter of my life, a roller coaster with all its high highs and low lows.
I am profoundly grateful for this opportunity, which has taught me so much, not only about science but also about society, friendship, and myself.
It is a journey for which I have to express my most sincerest thanks to many people.\hfill\break

First and foremost, I wish to express my gratitude to my supervisors, Henrik M. R{\o}nnow and Fabrizio Carbone, for giving me the opportunity to come to Switzerland and work in their labs.
I have greatly appreciated every scientific discussion, your honest feedback, and the exchange of ideas.
I am especially thankful for the openness with which I could approach you about anything, whether seeking advice or sharing concerns, which is far from guaranteed.
It speaks volumes that both of you created positive and motivating environments in your respective research groups.\hfill\break

I would also like to extend my thanks to Uwe Bovensiepen, Claude Monney and Gregor Jotzu for graciously serving on my doctoral committee.
I thoroughly enjoyed all the discussions, your insightful questions and exchanges we had during the day, as well as the defense itself.
Additionally, I want to thank Paolo De Los Rios for taking on the role as the president of the jury.\hfill\break

Now all of this would not have been possible without the colleagues I was able to spent time with over the years.
A big thank you goes to all members of LQM, past and present.
It has not been easy for me to participate on an everyday basis, being in two groups brings it own sets of challenges.
But despite this I always felt welcome and integrated, especially during group outings.
Especially the stay in Les Diablerets and the formation of the LQM logo in the snow will stay in my memory.
In particular, I want to thank Alexia, Davor and Ellen for helping me start my journey at EPFL, when I was completely lost.
I also want to thank Ivica, not only for integrating me into the group meetings and discussions, but also for always showing a positive spirit.
Also thank you to Daniil for your insights and the many ARPES-related discussions.\hfill\break

As I mentioned, I was fortunate to be part of two groups, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at LUMES with whom I had the privilege of working.
First, I want to extend my deepest thanks to Michele.
Your were not only a great colleague, always helpful and full of knowledge but also an unofficial third supervisor.
Thank you for initially integrating me into the ARPES team and helping me throughout countless challenges, and providing valuable feedback on this thesis.
I also want to thank the rest of the ARPES team that I was able to work with over the years. Thank you Ji, Alberto, Fei, Jona and Sophie for the joyful and collaborative atmosphere.

I also am grateful to you Francesco, for the countless discussion, shared beam times, schools and conferences, the late nights. Your support, even when it involved some debates, meant a great deal to me.
Siham, thank you for working with me over all the years. Even if it was not always easy I am grateful for the opportunities you gave me, the lessons about cuprates and all other insightful discussions over the years. I have learned a lot from you and value the perspective you brought to our work.
Simone, thank you for your friendship, long nights by the lake, and philosophical conversations.
Your presence made many difficult days easier, and I’ll never forget the amazing spongey cake you made!

To Thom, thank you for your readiness to listen, your efforts in organizing group outings and barbecues, and your input during scientific discussions. It was a pleasure to finally collaborate with you in the TEM toward the end of this journey.
Rémi and Paolo, the two PhD colleagues with whom I shared most of my time here, I want to sincerely thank you for your incredible friendship over the years. From countless laughs and inside jokes to meaningful scientific discussions and collaborations, your support has been invaluable throughout this journey.
To Veronica, Benoit, Alexey, Ivan, Paolo U., Hui-Yuan and Bruce , thank you for sharing this PhD experience with me.
Your friendship and the time we spent together at various conferences, dinner nights, group activities and of course no to forget Carlo Forte, made this time truly memorable.
I also want to thank Kjeld, Samuele, Antoine, Beatrice, Rahul, as well as Leonor and Chris, for your help over the years and shaping LUMES into what it is.\hfill\break

Apart from all the people I have met throughout my thesis here in Lausanne, I want to also thank all my friends that have shared my journey throughout the years.
To my high-school friends, Benedikt, Jannis, Lars and Maurice, as well as all the people from the "Jahrgang" group back in my home town, that I still have a close connection with.
Having friends with whom you can share both the highs and lows of life over so many years is profoundly meaningful.
Reflecting on all the memories we’ve created together fills me with immense gratitude and brings tears of joy to my eyes.
Thank you to everyone for being a part of my life for such a long time!\hfill\break

Finally, I want to thank my family.
To my parents, Anette and Jürgen, none of this would have been possible without your unwavering support and belief in me.
You nurtured my curiosity from a young age, always provided me with anything I needed, and most importantly were there for me when I needed support.
From the moment I decided to study Physics in Kaiserslautern, through my time abroad in the US, and finally to my move to Switzerland to begin my PhD, you have never doubted me. Your belief in me has been a constant source of strength, and for that, I am endlessly grateful.
To my brother Leon, even though we sometimes like to butt heads, I couldn't wish for a more supportive brother.
It is a blessing being able to support each other when in need, and trust to have each other's back.
At this point I would also like to thank my grandparents, Hedi and Leo, who have sadly passed away since I have moved to Switzerland.
I cannot thank them enough for raising me alongside my parents and for all the support and care they gave me throughout my life.
You are deeply missed!
Even though the past few years have been challenging, I couldn’t wish for a better family, one that stands by each other and remains united through all highs and lows.\hfill\break

Last but not least, I want to thank Phoebe.
I can't thank you enough for all the support and love you gave me throughout the years.
You’ve been my anchor through stressful times, helping me see what truly matters.
Being able to talk to someone who went through similar experiences is invaluable and opened my eyes in many regards.
Thank you for helping me strive to be my best self and for being my partner in every sense of the word.
I couldn’t have done it without you.\hfill\break

Thank you everyone, you have given me so much and shaped my journey into what it has become.

Forever grateful.
